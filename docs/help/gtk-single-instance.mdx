title: GTK Single Instance Mode
description: |-
  GTK single instance mode is a feature that ensures only one instance of the
  application is running at a time.
---

Ghostty uses GTK single instance mode by default when it detects
it is not launched from a CLI environment.

GTK single instance mode is recommended by the GTK project and is
the idiomatic way official Gnome applications are expected to behave.
When a second instance of Ghostty is launched, the original
instance will create a new window, gain focus, and terminate the
second instance.

<Tip>
  If you're using Ghostty on Linux and are experiencing slow startup times or
  high memory usage, GTK single instance detection may not be working for your
  environment and you may need to force it on. Continue reading this page to

## CLI Environment Detection

The default behavior of Ghostty is to use GTK single instance mode
**when _not_ launched from a CLI environment.**

Ghostty has this behavior because CLI terminal usage is common
(i.e. `ghostty -e "some command"`) and in those cases the expected
behavior is to launch a new process and block until it exits.
Single instance mode doesn't allow us to easily do this so we only
want to enable single instance mode when launched from a non-CLI
environment.

There isn't a standard API to detect if an application is launched
from a non-CLI environment, so Ghostty uses the following heuristic:

1. If the `TERM_PROGRAM` environment variable is set to any non-empty
   value, we're assume we're in a graphical terminal emulator and disable
   GTK single instance mode.

2. If any command line arguments are passed to Ghostty, we assume we
   want instance-specific configuration and disable GTK single instance mode.

## Forcing GTK Single Instance Mode On or Off

You can force GTK single instance mode on or off by setting the
[`gtk-single-instance`](/docs/config/reference#gtk-single-instance) option:

```ini
gtk-single-instance = true
```

A value of `true` forces Ghostty to run in single instance mode.
In this mode, each new `ghostty` process will result in a new window
in an existing instance of Ghostty if one is running.

## Relationship to Startup Performance and Memory

Ghostty is a GTK application. The GTK framework has unavoidable
overhead when starting up, both in terms of how long it takes and
how much memory it uses. Ghostty can't do anything about this.

GTK single instance mode avoids this overhead for subsequent
instances of Ghostty. Launching a second instance of Ghostty
will be extremely fast and use very little memory since it is
just creating a new window in the existing instance.
