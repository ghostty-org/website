title: GTK OpenGL Context Errors
description: |-
  In some situations, Ghostty may fail to start with an error about being
  "unable to acquire an OpenGL context". This page adds more details about
  this error and how to resolve it.
---

The Ghostty GTK application uses OpenGL for rendering. To render with
OpenGL, Ghostty needs to first acquire an "OpenGL context" from GTK. This
gives us the namespace to execute OpenGL commands.

In rare situations, GTK may be unable to provide Ghostty with an OpenGL
context. When this happens, Ghostty is unable to render anything and must
show this error.

This is **always an environment issue**. GTK provides Ghostty with the OpenGL
context, and there isn't generaly anything Ghostty itself can do to resolve
this directly. It is usually an issue regarding a library, driver, or OS
package version. This page will attempt to provide some assistance in
tracking down the issue.

## Quick Fixes

If you want to try to get Ghostty working quickly, try the following.

1. **Install a [binary package](/docs/install/binary).** If you're building
   from source, try using a binary package instead. Binary packages tend
   to be built in a more controlled environment that works with a specific
   distribution and its libraries.

2. **Check your GPU drivers.** GPU drivers are a common cause of OpenGL
   issues. Try updating or downgrading your GPU drivers, especially if
   you're using proprietary drivers.

3. **Build Ghostty from source using only system packages.** If you're using
   the Nix development environment to build Ghostty, try building it
   from source using only system packages. See the
   [build from source](/docs/install/build) instructions to do this
   (but ignore the "Building with Nix" section).

## Mismatched Library Versions

A common cause of this error is mismatched library versions. The balance
between GTK, [Mesa](https://mesa3d.org/), libX11/libwayland, and the kernel is
a fragile one.

**The first most common cause of this error is using the Nix development
environment to build Ghostty.** We recommend this environment for development,
but it does pin various versions of these libraries and they may be
incompatible with your global system. **To fix: try to build Ghostty using
only system dependency packages, or Ghostty itself from a system package.**
You can follow the [build from source](/docs/install/build) instructions
to do this (but ignore the "Building with Nix" section)

**Another common cause is outdated system packages.**
Linux distributions tend to handle this fragile balance for you, so the
try to update your entire system (or, specifically the
packages above, at least). This often brings your system back into a
coherent state that allows Ghostty to work.

**Check your GPU drivers.** Try updating or downgrading your GPU drivers.
We've had many cases where GPU driver changes have broken OpenGL in GTK.

## Known Historical Causes

- [Mesa 25.2.0 Regression](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13719).
  Ghostty doesn't bundle a libwayland clent library, but building Ghostty
  from source with the Nix development environment will use a different
  libwayland client library than the system one.

- [GTK4 + Nvidia + X11](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/4950).
  I don't know the exact combination required to trigger this, but it seems
  in certain scenarios, the mixture of GTK4 (required by Ghostty), Nvidia,
  and X11 can cause this issue. Changing driver versions or changing to
  Wayland can resolve this.
