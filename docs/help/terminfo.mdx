  Terminfo is used to tell software about the terminal's capabilities.
  Ghostty ships with its own terminfo entry to advertise its features.

[Terminfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminfo) is an archaic format
still in use by many terminal applications to determine the capabilities
of the terminal. Ghostty ships with its own terminfo entry to advertise
its features.

Ghostty uses the `TERM` value of `xterm-ghostty`.

<Note>
  **Why the `xterm` prefix?** Unfortunately, many terminal applications string
  search for "xterm" in the `TERM` value to _assume capabilities_. During the
  private beta, we experimented with a pure `ghostty` value, but found that too
  many applications broke and fixing the entire ecosystem was unrealistic. We
  settled on `xterm-ghostty` to maintain compatibility.
</Note>

Ghostty packages include the terminfo entry and set the proper filesystem
layouts or environment variables to make it available to the system.
When you run Ghostty, it will automatically set the `TERM` environment
variable to `xterm-ghostty` so long as it detects that the terminfo entry
is available.

<Important>
  **Ghostty's terminfo entry is available in ncurses 6.5-20241228 and above.**
  As distros update their ncurses packages, Ghostty's terminfo entry will be
  available by default system-wide. This will take time to propagate.
</Important>

## Sudo

If you use `sudo`, sudo may reset your environment variables and you may see
an error about `missing or unsuitable terminal: xterm-ghostty` when running
some programs.

To resolve this, you must either configure sudo to preserve
the `TERMINFO` environment variable, or you can use shell-integration with
the `sudo` feature enabled and Ghostty will alias sudo to automatically do
this for you. To enable the shell-integration feature specify
`shell-integration-features = sudo` in your configuration.

See
[`shell-integration-features`](/docs/config/reference#shell-integration-features)
for more about this configuration option.

## SSH

If you use SSH to connect to other machines that do not have Ghostty's
terminfo entry, you will see error messages like `missing or unsuitable
terminal: xterm-ghostty`, `Error opening terminal: xterm-ghostty.` or
`WARNING: terminal is not fully functional`.

Hopefully someday Ghostty will have terminfo entries pre-distributed
everywhere, but in the meantime there are two ways to resolve the situation:

1. Copy Ghostty's terminfo entry to the remote machine. The easiest way is using
   the following one-liner:
   ```sh
   infocmp -x xterm-ghostty | ssh YOUR-SERVER -- tic -x -
   ```
2. Configure SSH to fall back to a known terminfo entry using the following SSH
   configuration (**requires [OpenSSH 8.7](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.7)
   or newer**):
   ```ssh-config
   # .ssh/config
   Host example.com
     SetEnv TERM=xterm-256color
   ```

Both variants can be automated by specifying one or both of the following in
your Ghostty configuration:

1. `shell-integration-features = ssh-terminfo` to copy the terminfo entry the
   first time you log into a new server over SSH.
2. `shell-integration-features = ssh-env` to configure SSH to fall back to
   `xterm-256color`.

If both features are enabled
(`shell-integration-features = ssh-terminfo,ssh-env`), Ghostty will try to
install the terminfo entry first and use the fallback if installation failed.

See
[`shell-integration-features`](/docs/config/reference#shell-integration-features)
for more about this configuration option.

<Note>
  The `tic` command on the server may give the warning `"<stdin>", line 2,
  col 31, terminal 'xterm-ghostty': older tic versions may treat the description
  field as an alias` which can be safely ignored.
</Note>

<Note>
  `tic` will normally place its results in the system database,
  `/usr/share/terminfo`. This location can be overridden with the `TERMINFO`
  environment variable. If `TERMINFO` is not set and `tic` cannot write to the
  system location, it will place the results in `$HOME/.terminfo` if it exists.
  `man tic` for details.
</Note>

<Note>
  **macOS versions before Sonoma cannot use the system-bundled `infocmp`.** The
  bundled version of `ncurses` is too old to emit a terminfo entry that can be
  read by more recent versions of `tic`, and the command will fail with a bunch
  of `Illegal character` messages. You can fix this by using Homebrew to install
  a recent version of `ncurses` with `brew install ncurses`Â and replacing
  `infocmp` above with the full path `/opt/homebrew/opt/ncurses/bin/infocmp` or
  `/usr/local/opt/ncurses/bin/infocmp`.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Fallback does not support advanced terminal features.** Because
  `xterm-256color` does not include all of Ghostty's capabilities, terminal
  features beyond xterm's like colored and styled underlines will not work.
</Warning>
