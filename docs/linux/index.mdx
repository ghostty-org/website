  Ghostty works great on Linux, with support for both Wayland 
  and X11 and packages across a variety of distributions and
  formats.
---

Ghostty works really hard to "just work" on Linux, with detection
and code covering a wide variety of scenarios, but due to the diversity
of Linux distributions, desktop environments, launchers, etc. we
can't be perfect and some environments require additional notes.

This section covers Linux-specific information, including Linux-only
features of Ghostty, documentation on integrating Ghostty with specific
Linux distributions and environments, etc.

<Note>
  This section is dedicated to Linux for Linux users but Ghostty is just as
  first-class on macOS, as well, with a native application written in Swift and
  built with Xcode.

## Installing on Linux

Options for installing Ghostty on Linux include pre-built packages
on most popular distributions or building from source. Both of these
options are well documented at the links below.

## Supported GTK/Adwaita Versions

The table below shows the minimum required GTK and Adwaita versions
for specific Ghostty versions.

| Ghostty Version | GTK Version | Adwaita Version |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| 1.2.x           | 4.14        | 1.5             |
| 1.1.x           | 4.8         | 1.2             |

### Policy

The minimum required GTK and Adwaita versions for Ghostty is the
minimum version that is available in the most recent LTS releases of
Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu at the time of a Ghostty minor release.
In a Ghostty version number `X.Y.Z`, the `Y` is a minor release.

Patch releases will never bump dependency requirements, so users can always
safely and confidently update to the latest patch release within the same
minor release. In a Ghostty version number `X.Y.Z`, the `Z` is a patch release.

Ghostty supports many more distributions, but we explicitly specify Debian,
Fedora, and Ubuntu since they tend to have the most conservative package
repository practices that typically contain the oldest versions of any
other popular distributions.

<Note>
  **Why not continue to support older GTK/Adwaita versions?** Backporting
  feature support to older GTK/Adwaita versions is impractical from a
  maintenance perspective. Beyond a certain point, it overcomplicates the widget
  tree and the version sprawl becomes harder and harder to test against. We
  don't currently have a robust system for testing GUI interactions on older
  GTK/Adwaita versions beyond manual testing.
</Note>

<Note>
  **So if I have an older version of GTK/Adwaita, I can't use Ghostty?** Not
  necessarily. You can continue to use the specified Ghostty versions in the
  table above that match your GTK/Adwaita versions. If your GTK/Adwaita versions
  are older than the minimum required versions in the table, then unfortunately
  you will not be able to use Ghostty. Sorry.
</Note>

### Other Dependencies

Our other dependencies are typically much more API-stable so we tend to
support a wider range of versions than GTK and Adwaita. As a matter of policy,
we follow the same policy as stated above for all dependencies, but we're
more likely to be flexible with other dependencies.
