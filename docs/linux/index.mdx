  Ghostty works great on Linux, with support for both Wayland 
  and X11 and packages across a variety of distributions and
  formats.

Ghostty works really hard to "just work" on Linux, with detection
and code covering a wide variety of scenarios, but due to the diversity
of Linux distributions, desktop environments, launchers, etc. we
can't be perfect and some environments require additional notes.

This section covers Linux-specific information, including Linux-only
features of Ghostty, documentation on integrating Ghostty with specific
Linux distributions and environments, etc.

<Note>
This section is dedicated to Linux for Linux users but Ghostty is 
just as first-class on macOS, as well, with a native application
written in Swift and built with Xcode.
