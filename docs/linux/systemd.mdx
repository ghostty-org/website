title: Systemd and D-Bus Integration
description: |-
  Ghostty comes with built-in support for D-Bus activation and
  `systemd` services to launch on demand and create new windows
  instantly.
---

If properly installed[^1], Ghostty comes with several systemd units.
Running Ghostty via these systemd units is the recommended way to 
run Ghostty. The two most important benefits provided by Ghostty's 
systemd integrations are: instantaneous launching[^2] and centralized 
logging.

If you are on a system with `systemd` and you installed Ghostty
via a system package or [as documented](/docs/install/build),
then Ghostty should _just work_. You don't have to read this 
documentation unless you want to understand how this all works or
if you're troubleshooting.

<Important>
Ghostty **does not require systemd** to run. You can run the `ghostty`
binary directly on any system without systemd and Ghostty will still
work. However, you'll lose out on the benefits documented on this page.
</Important>

## Starting Ghostty at Login

Ghostty can be configured to start in the background on login,
so that future requests to create new windows are extremely fast.
This is done via `systemd` by enabling the Ghostty user service:

```sh
systemctl enable --user com.mitchell.ghostty.service
```

This will configure your system to start Ghostty when you log in, 
but not create any windows. Any startup delay will be "hidden" by 
the time that your system needs to finish setting up everything 
after logging in.

## Scripting New Windows

Typically, new windows in Ghostty can be created by using the
`ghostty` CLI directly. This will force a new Ghostty process to 
be created, which is slower and doesn't benefit from everything
documented on this page.

The following command can be used to send a D-Bus signal to 
Ghostty to create a new window:

```sh
gdbus call --session --dest com.mitchellh.ghostty --object-path /com/mitchellh/ghostty --method org.gtk.Actions.Activate new-window [] []
```

This will create a new window even if Ghostty is not already running,
because D-Bus activation will cause Ghostty to be launched.

<Note>
The `gdbus` command above can be intimidating to look at and is mostly
impossible to remember. We plan on introducing a `ghostty +new-window`
CLI command that automates this based on the runtime environment,
such as the OS, if systemd is available, etc.
</Note>

This command is very useful in particular for window managers such as
i3, Hyperland, or River. 

### Hyprland

The following is an example of how to bind `super+return` to open
a new Ghostty window in Hyprland. The configuration typically goes
in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```
bind = SUPER, return, exec, gdbus call --session --dest com.mitchellh.ghostty --object-path /com/mitchellh/ghostty --method org.gtk.Actions.Activate new-window [] []
```

## How Launching Works

On systems with `systemd` and D-Bus, Ghostty will launch via D-Bus
activation by default.

Instead of executing Ghostty directly, the application launcher will 
send a signal to the D-Bus session broker asking it to open a Ghostty
window. The D-Bus session broker knows if Ghostty is running or not,
because Ghostty will claim a specific bus name (`com.mitchellh.ghostty`).
If there is a program that claimed this bus name, it is assumed to be
Ghostty.

From this point, the behavior depends on whether Ghostty is already running
or not.

This process ensures that any startup delayed caused by GTK (or any
other initialization) is only incurred once if there are active
windows or if Ghostty is configured to remain running (not the
default).

### Ghostty is Already Running

If Ghostty is already running, the broker will send a D-Bus signal 
directly to Ghostty asking it to create a new window. Ghostty listens
for this signal and opens a new window. This is very fast, and very
cheap.

  </a>
</p>

### Ghostty is Not Running

If Ghostty is not running, the D-Bus session broker will ask `systemd` 
to start Ghostty in a user service, and then will send Ghostty a D-Bus 
signal to create a new window after it starts.

## Other

This "other" section collects less critical information or less
commonly used information. This information may still be extremely
useful (as such it is documented here), but it is not frequently
used.

### Logs

Logs emitted by Ghostty when run via systemd can be viewed using
`journalctl`:

```sh
journalctl -a -f --user -u com.mitchellh.ghostty.service
```

### Status

The following command will show you the status of Ghostty:

```sh
systemctl status --user com.mitchellh.ghostty.service
```

Which should produce output similar to the following:

```
● com.mitchellh.ghostty.service - Ghostty

```

### Stopping

The Ghostty `systemd` user service can be stopped by running:

```sh
systemctl stop --user com.mitchellh.ghostty.service
```

<Caution>
This will gracefully stop Ghostty, but Ghostty will close any windows
and kill their running processes _without asking for confirmation_.
This may cause data or state loss.
</Caution>

### Relevant Files

If properly installed [^1], Ghostty will come with several configuration
files to launch Ghostty. 

If installed as a user (e.g. at `$HOME/.local`), the following files
will be created:

```
$PREFIX/share/applications/com.mitchellh.ghostty.desktop
$PREFIX/share/dbus-1/services/com.mitchellh.ghostty.service
$PREFIX/share/systemd/user/com.mitchellh.ghostty.service
```

If installed as a system package, the following files will be created:

```
$PREFIX/share/applications/com.mitchellh.ghostty.desktop
$PREFIX/share/dbus-1/services/com.mitchellh.ghostty.service
$PREFiX/lib/systemd/user/com.mitchellh.ghostty.service
```

<Warning>
If these files are not installed in the proper locations and configured
correctly **Ghostty may fail to launch**. If they are installed in the
proper location and Ghostty is still not launching, log out and log
back in. If that doesn't work, try restarting your system. This should
rarely be necessary, but it can happen depending on system configuration.
</Warning>

### Dev Builds

If you have installed a development build of Ghostty (in `Debug` mode),
paths on this page need to be altered slightly:

```sh
systemctl enable --user com.mitchell.ghostty-debug.service
journalctl -a -f --user -u com.mitchellh.ghostty-debug.service
gdbus call --session --dest com.mitchellh.ghostty-debug --object-path /com/mitchellh/ghostty_debug --method org.gtk.Actions.Activate new-window [] []
```

These are the files that control the launching of debug versions of Ghostty if
installed as a user:

```
$PREFIX/share/applications/com.mitchellh.ghostty-debug.desktop
$PREFIX/share/dbus-1/services/com.mitchellh.ghostty-debug.service
$PREFIX/share/systemd/user/com.mitchellh.ghostty-debug.service
```

If installed as a system package, the files will be found in the following
locations:

```
$PREFIX/share/applications/com.mitchellh.ghostty-debug.desktop
$PREFIX/share/dbus-1/services/com.mitchellh.ghostty-debug.service
$PREFiX/lib/systemd/user/com.mitchellh.ghostty-debug.service
```

[^1]: "Properly installed" means via a package that followed our
packaging guidelines or from source in `$HOME/.local`.

[^2]: "Instantaneous" is hyperbolic, of course. Practically speaking,
launching a new Ghostty window goes from somewhere around 300ms on
a modern system to around 20ms. These numbers will vary based on hardware,
but the relative increase should be noticeable on all systems.
