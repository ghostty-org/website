Ghostty includes a number of utility actions that can be accessed as subcommands.
Actions provide utilities to work with config, list keybinds, list fonts, demo themes,
and debug.
## version
The `version` command is used to display information about Ghostty. Recognized as
either `+version` or `--version`.

```
ghostty --version
```

## help
The `help` command shows general help about Ghostty. Recognized as either
`-h, `--help`, or like other actions `+help`.

You can also specify `--help` or `-h` along with any action such as
`+list-themes` to see help for a specific action.

```
ghostty --help
```

## list-fonts
The `list-fonts` command is used to list all the available fonts for
Ghostty. This uses the exact same font discovery mechanism Ghostty uses to
find fonts to use.

When executed with no arguments, this will list all available fonts, sorted
by family name, then font name. If a family name is given with `--family`,
the sorting will be disabled and the results instead will be shown in the
same priority order Ghostty would use to pick a font.

Flags:

  * `--bold`: Filter results to specific bold styles. It is not guaranteed
    that only those styles are returned. They are only prioritized.

  * `--italic`: Filter results to specific italic styles. It is not guaranteed
    that only those styles are returned. They are only prioritized.

  * `--style`: Filter results based on the style string advertised by a font.
    It is not guaranteed that only those styles are returned. They are only
    prioritized.

  * `--family`: Filter results to a specific font family. The family handling
    is identical to the `font-family` set of Ghostty configuration values, so
    this can be used to debug why your desired font may not be loading.

```
ghostty +list-fonts
```

## list-keybinds
The `list-keybinds` command is used to list all the available keybinds for
Ghostty.

When executed without any arguments this will list the current keybinds
loaded by the config file. If no config file is found or there aren't any
changes to the keybinds it will print out the default ones configured for
Ghostty

Flags:

  * `--default`: will print out all the default keybinds

  * `--docs`: currently does nothing, intended to print out documentation
    about the action associated with the keybinds

  * `--plain`: will disable formatting and make the output more
    friendly for Unix tooling. This is default when not printing to a tty.

```
ghostty +list-keybinds
```

## list-themes
The `list-themes` command is used to preview or list all the available
themes for Ghostty.

If this command is run from a TTY, a TUI preview of the themes will be
shown. While in the preview, `F1` will bring up a help screen and `ESC` will
exit the preview. Other keys that can be used to navigate the preview are
listed in the help screen.

If this command is not run from a TTY, or the output is piped to another
command, a plain list of theme names will be printed to the screen. A plain
list can be forced using the `--plain` CLI flag.

Two different directories will be searched for themes.

The first directory is the `themes` subdirectory of your Ghostty
configuration directory. This is `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/ghostty/themes` or
`~/.config/ghostty/themes`.

The second directory is the `themes` subdirectory of the Ghostty resources
directory. Ghostty ships with a multitude of themes that will be installed
into this directory. On macOS, this directory is the
`Ghostty.app/Contents/Resources/ghostty/themes`. On Linux, this directory
is the `share/ghostty/themes` (wherever you installed the Ghostty "share"
directory). If you're running Ghostty from the source, this is the
`zig-out/share/ghostty/themes` directory.

You can also set the `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR` environment variable to point
to the resources directory.

Flags:

  * `--path`: Show the full path to the theme.

  * `--plain`: Force a plain listing of themes.

```
ghostty +list-themes
```

## list-colors
The `list-colors` command is used to list all the named RGB colors in
Ghostty.

```
ghostty +list-colors
```

## list-actions
The `list-actions` command is used to list all the available keybind
actions for Ghostty. These are distinct from the CLI Actions which can
be listed via `+help`

Flags:

  * `--docs`: will print out the documentation for each action.

```
ghostty +list-actions
```

## show-config
The `show-config` command shows the current configuration in a valid Ghostty
configuration file format.

When executed without any arguments this will output the current
configuration that is different from the default configuration. If you're
using the default configuration this will output nothing.

If you are a new user and want to see all available options with
documentation, run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs`.

The output is not in any specific order, but the order should be consistent
between runs. The output is not guaranteed to be exactly match the input
configuration files, but it will result in the same behavior. Comments,
whitespace, and other formatting is not preserved from user configuration
files.

Flags:

  * `--default`: Show the default configuration instead of loading
    the user configuration.

  * `--changes-only`: Only show the options that have been changed
    from the default. This has no effect if `--default` is specified.

  * `--docs`: Print the documentation above each option as a comment,
    This is very noisy but is very useful to learn about available
    options, especially paired with `--default`.

```
ghostty +show-config
```

## validate-config
The `validate-config` command is used to validate a Ghostty config file.

When executed without any arguments, this will load the config from the default
location.

Flags:

  * `--config-file`: can be passed to validate a specific target config file in
    a non-default location

```
ghostty +validate-config
```

## show-face
The `show-face` command shows what font face Ghostty will use to render a
specific codepoint. Note that this command does not take into consideration
grapheme clustering or any other Unicode features that might modify the
presentation of a codepoint, so this may show a different font face than
Ghostty uses to render a codepoint in a terminal session.

Flags:

  * `--cp`: Find the face for a single codepoint. The codepoint may be specified
    in decimal (`--cp=65`), hexadecimal (`--cp=0x41`), octal (`--cp=0o101`), or
    binary (`--cp=0b1000001`).

  * `--string`: Find the face for all of the codepoints in a string. The
    string must be a valid UTF-8 sequence.

  * `--style`: Search for a specific style. Valid options are `regular`, `bold`,
    `italic`, and `bold_italic`.

  * `--presentation`: If set, force searching for a specific presentation
    style. Valid options are `text` and `emoji`. If unset, the presentation
    style of a codepoint will be inferred from the Unicode standard.

```
ghostty +show-face
```

## crash-report
The `crash-report` command is used to inspect and send crash reports.

When executed without any arguments, this will list existing crash reports.

This command currently only supports listing crash reports. Viewing
and sending crash reports is unimplemented and will be added in the future.

```
ghostty +crash-report
```
