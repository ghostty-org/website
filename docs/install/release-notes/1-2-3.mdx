## Highlights

### macOS Titlebar Tabs Improvements

PRs: GH-9090 GH-9163 GH-9168 GH-1787 GH-1813 GH-1945 GH-8612

Ghostty 1.2.3 includes multiple fixes for `macos-titlebar-style = tabs`,
including many issues that have existed since pre-1.0! Additionally, multiple
Tahoe-specific (macOS 26) bugs related to this configuration were also fixed,
since Tahoe introduced a dramatically different tab bar.

An overview of the changes:

- Fixed title misalignment and clipping in tab titlebar style.
- Corrected titlebar coloring in fullscreen mode when titlebar tabs are enabled.
- Resolved issues where theme changes would cause the titlebar to lose styling.
- Fixed truncated title appearing in top-left corner when using tab titlebar
  style in fullscreen.
- Improved behavior with macOS 26 native fullscreen and titlebar tabs.

### Font Rendering Improvements

PRs: GH-9142 GH-9152 GH-9160

Ghostty 1.2.3 continues to include a number of refinements to the rewritten
font rendering system introduced in 1.2.0. The changes in Ghostty 1.2.3
focus primarily on icon glyphs (e.g. Nerd Fonts). Ghostty 1.2.3 users should
see better sized icons in all scenarios.

This addresses all currently known font _rendering_ issues, particularly
those stemming from the rewritten renderer in 1.2.0. Note that there are
still other known font-related issues but they either predate Ghostty 1.2
or are otherwise unrelated to font rendering (and are instead related to
font discovery, loading, shaping, etc.).

## Full Changelog

[Full list of closed issues on GitHub](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/milestone/10?closed=1).

In each section, we try to sort improvements before bug fixes.

- font: Numerous tweaks to improve various edge cases, especially around
  icon glyphs. GH-9076 GH-9142 GH-9160 GH-9152
- terminal: add semi-colon character to word boundary list for selection. GH-9069
- input: modify other keys 2 should use all mods, ignore consumed mods.
  This fixes a misencoding that caused shifted modifiers to not work
  with tmux (but also any other terminal program using modify other keys state 2)
  GH-9289
- Fix a deadlock scenario where programs that emit many color change
  or query operations could cause Ghostty to hang. GH-9224
- Fix a resource leak by not starting the scroll timer when scrolling
  outside the viewport if the scroll timer is already active. GH-9195
- Fix memory corruption that could happen when starting a scroll in
  one screen (primary vs alt) and continuing to scroll after the terminal
  program switched screens. GH-9223
- renderer: fix garbled rendering under some cases. GH-9252
- shell-integration: `ssh-terminfo` now caches properly for IPv6 addresses. GH-9251 GH-9281
- shell-integration: cursor integration now works in vi mode for fish. GH-9157
- shell-integration: no longer updates universal `fish_user_paths` variable. GH-9273

### macOS

- macOS: Quick terminal size is now properly remembered per screen. GH-9256
- macOS: `goto_split` direction is now compatible with `performable:` bindings.
  GH-9283 GH-9284
- macOS: `window-position-x/y` works properly paired with `window-width/height`. GH-9313
- macOS: Fix UI hang when pasting large unsafe text. GH-9322 GH-9324
- macOS: Fixed multiple `macos-titlebar-style=tabs` related issues. GH-1787
  GH-1813 GH-1945 GH-8612 GH-9090 GH-9163
- macOS: New Tab action now reliably opens tab instead of window when
  appropriate. GH-9124

### GTK (Linux, FreeBSD)

- GTK: If `title` is configured, set the correct window title immediately. GH-9120
- GTK: quick terminal autohide now works properly. GH-9145 GH-9139

### Changes for Package Maintainers

- A new `-Demit-themes` (default true) build option has been added to
  build Ghostty without any bundled themes. This was added for packagers
  who are sensitive to licensing issues that may exist in our upstream
  dependency. We're looking into this in more detail but this is meant as
  a short-term solution to avoid the themes entirely if there are concerns.
  GH-9288

## Roadmap

We don't plan on releasing any further 1.2.x releases, except in the
circumstance that a critical issue is found. The 1.2.x series has already
been very stable, and we believe 1.2.3 addresses the remaining major issues
that exist.

That doesn't mean Ghostty is without bugs, of course! We'll continue to fix
bugs and improve features, but unless those bugs are critical, we'll hold
their release until Ghostty 1.3.0.
