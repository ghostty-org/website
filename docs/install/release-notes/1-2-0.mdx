  Release notes for Ghostty 1.2.0, released on September 15, 2025.
---

Ghostty 1.2.0 features **6 months of work** with changes from
**149 contributors** over **2,676 commits**. Thank you to all the contributors,
maintainers, community moderators, translators, packagers, and users
who each helped make this release possible. This release contains major
improvements to every part of Ghostty, including hundreds of bug fixes.

## Security

- macOS: [GHSA-q9fg-cpmh-c78x](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/security/advisories/GHSA-q9fg-cpmh-c78x).
  Fixed an issue where Ghostty can be used as a vector for privilege
  escalation from other vulnerable or malicious sources. This requires a
  vulnerable application outside of Ghostty to initiate this chain of events.
  As such, this is considered a low risk advisory.

## Highlights

### New App Icons

PRs: GH-7638 GH-8038

On macOS, Ghostty 1.2 ships with a new macOS Tahoe compatible icon shown
below. This icon is built with the new Icon Composer application and allows
the icon to work with all of the new macOS light, dark, translucent, and
custom tinting styles.

<p align="center">
  <a href="/images/1-2-0/macos.png" target="_blank">
    <img
      src="/images/1-2-0/macos.png"
      width="160"
      style={{ maxWidth: "50%", margin: "10px" }}
    />
  </a>
</p>

On GTK (Linux and FreeBSD), Ghostty 1.2 ships with a new icon that better
matches _many_ desktop environments. We chose to align with the GNOME styling
since that is common and doesn't generally look out of place in most
environments.

<p align="center">
  <a href="/images/1-2-0/gnome.png" target="_blank">
    <img
      src="/images/1-2-0/gnome.png"
      width="200"
      style={{ maxWidth: "50%", margin: "10px" }}
    />
  </a>
</p>

<Note>
  It's impossible to make a perfect, globally consistent icon for the Linux and
  BSD ecosystem due to the diversity of desktop environments. We believe this
  icon looks better in more environments than the prior icon, and avoids some
  negative reactions that the prior icon demonstrated a macOS-centric point of
  view.
</Note>

### Command Palette

PRs: GH-7153 GH-7156

Ghostty now has a command palette that can invoke most keybind actions,
such as creating new terminals, moving focus, changing text selection,
copy and paste, etc.

The command palette is bound by default to `ctrl+shift+p` on GTK and
`cmd+shift+p` on macOS. This can be rebound to any keybind using the
`toggle_command_palette` keybind action. The command palette is also available
via the menubar on both macOS and GTK.

<p align="center">
  <a href="/images/1-2-0/palette-macos.png" target="_blank">
    <img
      src="/images/1-2-0/palette-macos.png"
      style={{ maxWidth: "90%", margin: "10px" }}
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <a href="/images/1-2-0/palette-gtk.png" target="_blank">
    <img
      src="/images/1-2-0/palette-gtk.png"
      style={{ maxWidth: "90%", margin: "10px" }}
    />
  </a>
</p>

The command palette exposes almost every available keybind. As new keybind
actions are added to Ghostty, they will be automatically available in the
command palette as well. This has some immediate benefits, namely that you can
access keybind actions even if they aren't bound to a keybind. This is useful
for infrequently used actions.

For example, I personally find myself using the `move_tab` action via the
command palette frequently, but not frequently enough to justify binding it.

In future versions of Ghostty, we'll continue to expand the features that
are available in the command palette. For example, we're working on a new
terminal sequence specification that would allow terminal programs to expose
any of their actions directly in the command palette (e.g. imagine Neovim
commands being fully available in the command palette).

### Quick Terminal Size

PRs: GH-2384

A new configuration `quick-terminal-size` can now configure the default size
of the quick terminal. This was one of the most highly requested features.

The `quick-terminal-size` configuration supports both percentage and pixel
size. If you specify only one value, it specifies the size of the primary
axis (depending on the location). If you specify two values, then the second
value is the secondary axis. The example below illustrates:

```
# Percentage, primary axis only
quick-terminal-size = 25%

# Pixels work too, primary axis only
quick-terminal-size = 600px

# Two values specify primary and secondary axis
quick-terminal-size = 25%,75%

# You can also mix units
quick-terminal-size = 300px,80%
```

The _primary axis_ is defined by the `quick-terminal-position` configuration.
For the `top` and `bottom` values, the primary axis is the height. For
the `left` and `right` values, the primary axis is the width. For `center`,
it depends on your monitor orientation: it is height for landscape and width for
portrait.

Beyond simply specifying the size, the quick terminal is now resizable at
runtime and will remember that size for the duration that Ghostty is running.
In prior versions, the size was fixed, which caused real problems depending
on monitor size and resolution.

Screenshots with a couple examples on GTK are shown below:

<p align="center">
  <a href="/images/1-2-0/quick-terminal-pos1.png" target="_blank">
    <img
      src="/images/1-2-0/quick-terminal-pos1.png"
      style={{ maxWidth: "85%", margin: "10px" }}
    />
  </a>
</p>

  <a href="/images/1-2-0/quick-terminal-pos2.png" target="_blank">
    <img
      src="/images/1-2-0/quick-terminal-pos2.png"
      style={{ maxWidth: "85%", margin: "10px" }}
    />
  </a>
</p>

### SSH Improvements (Work-in-Progress)

PR: GH-7608

Ghostty now has opt-in shell integration features to make Ghostty more
compatible with SSH for remote machines that haven't updated to support
[Ghostty's terminfo](/docs/help/terminfo).

The new `ssh-env` opt-in feature will automatically set the `TERM` variable
to `xterm-256color` for SSH sessions (as well as forward some other
environment variables to make sessions work better). While not strictly correct,
this band-aid solution helps more than it hurts in most cases.

The new `ssh-terminfo` opt-in feature will automatically copy the Ghostty
terminfo to the remote machine so that the proper `xterm-ghostty` `TERM`
setting can be used and remote programs can take full advantage of all of
Ghostty's features (and avoid xterm features we don't support).

Both of these features are opt-in because they require overriding the `ssh`
command in your shell. This operation is not without risk, so we want to make
sure users are aware of what they're doing. We do our best to make this
stable and reliable, but there are edge cases we can't account for. As such,
this is still a work-in-progress and we welcome feedback.

### Renderer Rework

PRs: GH-7620

The renderer backends have been reworked so that the core logic is shared,
whether rendering with OpenGL or Metal. This change will allow for quicker
improvements to that area of the code in the future, and will also help to
ensure feature parity between the two backends, which is something that was
starting to become an issue as many features were implemented for Metal but
not for OpenGL.

In the process of this rework, several improvements were made for the OpenGL
backend, which should now be more efficient and has near feature parity with
the Metal backend.

This means that Linux users will now see proper linear alpha blending, which
removes artifacts seen around the edges of text with certain combinations of
background and foreground color. The default `alpha-blending` configuration
value on Linux is now `linear-corrected`, which performs linear blending with
a correction step for text so that the apparent weight matches the non-linear
blending that people are used to.

This rework also made it so that custom shaders can now be hot reloaded.

### Custom Cursor Shaders

PRs: GH-7648

Custom shaders are now provided information about the terminal cursor, so that
custom effects and animations can be applied to it, like a trail or smear.

The example below shows a
["cursor blaze" shader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackr-sh/ghostty-shaders/refs/heads/main/cursor_blaze.glsl)
that leaves a trail behind the cursor as it moves:

<Video src="https://web.files.ghostty.org/release-notes-1-2-0-cursor-trails.mp4" />

Cursor shaders and custom shaders in general are not for everyone, but
we've seen some incredibly creative shaders from the community. A lot of
people are having a lot of fun, and beyond simple eye candy they can be
practically useful too, such as making the cursor easier to follow as it
moves (but perhaps less loudly).

We do eventually plan to add a first-party animated cursor, so that users don't
need to take on the additional performance cost of a custom shader just to have
a cursor that's easier to follow as it moves, but adding this feature to custom
shaders was an easy stop-gap measure. Plus, this will still be useful even after
we add the first-party animated cursors, since some users may still want to have
very specific custom effects that aren't possible through the built-in option.

### Terminal Background Images

PRs: GH-3645

You can now specify a background image for your terminal using the
`background-image` configuration. This comes with a set of other
configurations so that the image appears just how you'd like it:
`background-image-opacity`, `background-image-position`,
`background-image-fit`, and `background-image-repeat`.

<p align="center">
  <a href="/images/1-2-0/background-image.png" target="_blank">
    <img
      src="/images/1-2-0/background-image.png"
      style={{ maxWidth: "85%", margin: "10px" }}
    />
  </a>
</p>

<Warning>
  In Ghostty 1.2.0, the background image is duplicated in VRAM for each
  terminal. For sufficiently large images and many terminals, this can lead to a
  large increase in memory usage (specifically VRAM). A future Ghostty release
  will share image textures across terminals to avoid this issue.
</Warning>

### Graphical Progress Bars

PRs: GH-7975, GH-8477

Ghostty now recognizes the [ConEmu `OSC 9;4` sequences](https://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html#ConEmu_specific_OSC)
and renders a GUI native progress bar.

As far as we know, we believe Ghostty is the first terminal emulator on
macOS to support this feature. Multiple terminals other than Ghostty on both
Linux and Windows already support this feature.

Progress bars can show success/error states, numerical progress towards
completion, indeterminate progress (pulsing), and more. Programs like
[Amp](https://ampcode.com/) are already utilizing the progress bar today to
show activity, as shown below:

<Video src="https://web.files.ghostty.org/release-notes-1-2-0-progress.mp4" />

Graphical progress bars are now supported by multiple terminals across Windows,
Linux, and macOS as well as a handful of major terminal programs such as
the systemd and Zig CLIs. We hope, given the growing terminal support, that more
programs will start using this feature.

Today, Ghostty shows a simple, basic progress bar at the top of the terminal.
In future versions, we will expand progress so it is shown in tab headers,
task bars, dock icons, etc.

<Note>
  The progress report `OSC 9;4` sequence collides with the iTerm2 notification
  sequence. Ghostty is the only emulator to support both sequences. To handle
  this, `OSC 9;4` always parses as a progress report, meaning you can't send any
  notifications starting with `;4` as notifications. We think this is a
  reasonable trade-off given the extremely specific text and the wider support
  for the more recommended `OSC 777` notification sequence.
</Note>

### Fallback Font Size Adjustment

PRs: GH-7840, GH-7953

When the font(s) you configured for Ghostty don't have a glyph for a character
we need to render, we find a font on the system that does. These fonts are now
adjusted in size to better match the primary font. This is similar (but
not identical) to [`font-size-adjust` in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size-adjust).

This helps account for the differing sizes of fonts, and creates a generally
more consistent appearance. This is also helpful for users who use multiple
writing systems; for example, CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) text now
avoids having large vertical "gutters" between characters.

| Ghostty 1.1.3 (Old)                                                                          | Ghostty 1.2.0 (New)                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p align="center"><img src="/images/1-2-0/adjust-old.png" style={{ maxWidth: "90%" }} /></p> | <p align="center"><img src="/images/1-2-0/adjust-new.png" style={{ maxWidth: "90%" }} /></p> |

The example above is a subtle difference. The difference is more apparent
when many differing font faces get used in a single line. To ensure we were
on the right path, we also polled a number of Chinese readers within
the community and feedback leaned strongly positive towards the new behavior.

In the future, we plan to rework font configuration so that you can specify
sizes per-font, or let a configured font be sized automatically like fallback
fonts are.

### Lots of New Built-in Glyphs

PRs: GH-7732, GH-7755, GH-7761

A variety of new characters are now drawn directly by Ghostty instead of having
to rely on a font for them. We draw glyphs directly so that we can ensure they
align correctly with the cell and each other.

An example of just a fraction of the newly supported glyphs is shown below.
Notice how the glyphs align perfectly with each other along the cell edges
with no gaps in between. This kind of pixel-perfect rendering is very important
for TUI applications that use glyphs such as these for UI elements.

| Ghostty 1.1.3 (Old)                                                                           | Ghostty 1.2.0 (New)                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p align="center"><img src="/images/1-2-0/sprites-old.png" style={{ maxWidth: "66%" }} /></p> | <p align="center"><img src="/images/1-2-0/sprites-new.png" style={{ maxWidth: "66%" }} /></p> |

### Built-in Nerd Font Improvement

PRs: GH-7809, and subsequent PRs to fix minor issues

The built-in Nerd Font symbols are now provided by a standalone symbols-only
font, rather than using patched versions of JetBrains Mono in Regular, Bold,
Italic, and Bold Italic styles, and the built-in JetBrains Mono now uses a
variable font rather than 4 static ones. This makes it so that the embedded
fonts in Ghostty take significantly less space than they used to.

This also means we're now using a more up-to-date copy of the Nerd Fonts
symbols, so newer symbols will now render correctly.

The big change, however, is that Ghostty now automatically resizes Nerd Fonts
symbols to match the cell size, in the same way that the official Nerd Fonts
patcher does, which means that the experience of using Ghostty with a normal
un-patched font should be nearly or completely identical to using it with a
patched font before.

This means that there is now _no reason_ to use patched fonts in Ghostty, since
things like powerline glyphs will always be scaled appropriately for the cell
size either way.

### Key Binding Rework

PR: GH-7320

We've reworked our keybindings to be more consistent, based on the
[W3C key event code specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/).
This work should result in more predictable, working keybindings across
operating systems and keyboard layouts, but also brings with it some
**major behavior changes that may break existing keybindings.**

All single codepoint characters now match the character produced by the
keyboard layout (i.e. are layout-dependent). So `ctrl+c` matches the
physical "c" key on a US standard keyboard with a US layout, but matches
the "i" key on a Dvorak layout. This also works for international characters.
Codepoints are case-insensitive and match via Unicode case folding (this is
how both Windows and macOS treat keyboard shortcuts).

All other key names match physical keys, and the key names are named
according to the W3C key codes. Example: `ctrl+KeyA` will always match the "a"
key on a US physical layout (the name `KeyA` lining up with US keyboards is
mandated by the spec, not us). Note when we say "physical" here we mean the
keycode sent by the OS or GUI framework; these can often be overridden
using programs to remap keys at the "hardware" level but software layouts
do not do this.

As a result of the above, **the `physical:` prefix has been removed.**
Physical keybinds are now explicit through the use of multi-codepoint key
names as noted above. Previous `physical:` keybinds continue to work but
should be updated to the new format.

For backwards compatibility, all existing key names in Ghostty that didn't
match W3C map to their W3C equivalent. For example, `grave_accent` maps to
`backquote`.

### Terminal Bell

PRs: GH-7099, GH-5326, GH-7087, GH-7101, GH-7118, GH-7148, GH-7842, GH-7533

Ghostty on both macOS and GTK support the terminal bell (ASCII `BEL` or
`0x07`). Ghostty's behavior when the bell is rung can be customized using
the `bell-features` configuration. We've shipped with defaults which we believe
are the least intrusive while still being useful, and more intrusive optional
features can be set with `bell-features`.

On macOS, the bell by default will put the bell emoji (🔔) in the title of
the terminal, will bounce the dock icon once, and will put a badge on the
Ghostty icon visible in the dock and application switcher. No audio will be
played.

On GTK, the bell by default will put the bell emoji (🔔) in the title of
the terminal and will mark the window as requesting attention. The exact
behavior of "requesting attention" is determined by the window manager or
desktop environment. No audio will be played.

GTK also supports an audio bell feature which is off by default. This can be
enabled with `bell-features=audio`. You can even specify custom audio to
play using the `bell-audio-path` configuration. The `bell-features=system`
feature (default off) will use the "system beep" which usually can be audio
as well, configured via a central system setting.

GTK also supports a border flashing animation that can be enabled with
`bell-features=border`. This is similar to the "visual bell" feature provided
by other terminal emulators.

A future version of Ghostty will bring parity to macOS with all the bell
features.

### Terminal Emulation Compatibility

Ghostty 1.2 includes dozens of improvements to core terminal emulation to
ensure terminal programs work consistently and correctly in Ghostty as they
do in other terminal emulators. You can find the full list of related changes
in the [terminal capabilities](#terminal-capabilities) section.

The improvements range from very minor (GH-7443, a sequence not used by any
known program in the wild) to very important (GH-8590, which broke some real
programs). In any case, Ghostty takes terminal emulation compatibility very
seriously and we work hard to ensure that Ghostty can support the wide
spectrum of terminal features that exist.

Getting this right is easier said than done: a very small subset of terminal
emulation functionality is formally specified, with the vast majority
being defined by de facto standards based on how terminal emulators behave.
Additionally, since no singular standards body exists, protocols often
conflict with each other and we're left determining which protocol is more
important or how we can compromise to support both.

For example, the [progress bars](#graphical-progress-bars) sequence
collides with the iTerm2 desktop notification sequence. As a compromise,
any unambiguous progress bar sequence takes priority over notifications,
so if you wanted to send a notification that exactly said the sequence to
set a progress bar, it will not work. This is a compromise Ghostty made
so that we can be one of the only terminals to support both progress bars
and iTerm2 desktop notifications.[^2]

### macOS: Tahoe Support

Ghostty 1.2 adds support for macOS 26 (Tahoe).

When running on macOS 26, Ghostty will use the new Liquid Glass style. The
[app icon has been updated](/docs/install/release-notes/1-2-0#new-app-icons)
to support macOS 26 features such as light, dark, tinting, etc.
A number of UI details have been updated to better match the new macOS style,
such as icons in menu bars. In addition to visual support, a number of
compatibility issues were also fixed.

Ghostty 1.2 remains fully compatible with prior macOS versions back to
and including macOS 13 (Ventura).

<Note>
  Ghostty 1.1.x is functional on macOS 26. Due to the way macOS SDKs work,
  Ghostty 1.1.x will use the old pre-Tahoe UI styling. There are still some
  compatibility issues, but it is largely functional if you are unable to
  upgrade to Ghostty 1.2 in the near term.
</Note>

### macOS: Undo/Redo Close

PRs: GH-7535

All operations that close a terminal now support undo and redo using
standard macOS keybinds (`Cmd+Z` and `Cmd+Shift+Z`, but can be rebound).
This includes closing a split, closing a tab, closing a window, closing
all windows, closing other tabs, etc.

Undo/redo works by keeping recently closed terminals running but hidden
for a configurable amount of time (by default 5 seconds). During this time,
you can undo the close and the terminal will be reopened in the same location
as before. Since the terminal was always running, your exact terminal state
is restored.

The time that a terminal can be undone can be configured with the
`undo-timeout` configuration.

<Video src="https://web.files.ghostty.org/release-notes-1-2-0-undo.mp4" />

In future versions of Ghostty we plan to expand the GUI interactions
that can be undone and redone, such as resizing splits, moving tabs, etc.

### macOS: Apple Shortcuts

PR: GH-7634

Ghostty on macOS now integrates with Apple Shortcuts. This enables a Ghostty
to be scripted on macOS, especially when combined with non-Ghostty-specific
shortcut actions like taking screenshots, moving windows, etc.

<p align="center">
  <a href="/images/1-2-0/shortcuts.png" target="_blank">
    <img
      src="/images/1-2-0/shortcuts.png"
      style={{ maxWidth: "85%", margin: "10px" }}
    />
  </a>
</p>

Apple Shortcuts can be bound to global shortcuts, synced across devices,
and more. It is a really powerful tool!

This feature doesn't replace our future plans for a full cross-platform
Ghostty API. This macOS-specific feature does address many of those use cases
for macOS users, but we still plan to build alternate scripting choices in
the future.

### GTK: Quick Terminal

PRs: GH-4624

The quick terminal is now supported on Linux while running on Wayland
with access to the
[widely supported `wlr-layer-shell` protocol](https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1#compositor-support).
The quick terminal has been available on macOS since Ghostty 1.0.

As a reminder, the "quick terminal" is the feature of Ghostty where a
singleton window of a terminal can be shown and hidden with a single
hotkey bound to `toggle_quick_terminal` (usually a global hotkey that
works even when Ghostty isn't focused). This is sometimes referred to
as a "dropdown terminal" or a "DOOM-style terminal."

The quick terminal on Linux fully supports tabs and splits.

<p align="center">
  <a href="/images/1-2-0/quick-terminal-gtk.png" target="_blank">
    <img
      src="/images/1-2-0/quick-terminal-gtk.png"
      style={{ maxWidth: "90%", margin: "10px" }}
    />
  </a>
</p>

### GTK: Global Keybinds

PRs: GH-6051

The GTK application now supports global keybinds, keybinds that
work even while Ghostty is not the focused application. These keybinds
are defined with the `global:` prefix in the Ghostty configuration.

Global keybinds require a functional XDG desktop portal installed on your
system. Other parts of Ghostty already rely on XDG desktop portal, so it likely
already exists. If not, it's usually a single well-supported package away (plus
a restart).

Global keybinds support any keybind action but are particularly well
suited when paired with features such as `toggle_quick_terminal`, which is
now [also supported on GTK](#gtk:-quick-terminal).

### GTK: Localization (Work-in-Progress)

PRs: GH-6004 plus too many to list for each locale.

Preliminary support for localization of the GTK application has been added.
Currently, only GTK GUI elements are translated. Localization support for
macOS and other parts of Ghostty will arrive in future releases.

Ghostty 1.2 has complete localization for GUI elements for the following
locales:

- bg_BG
- ca_ES
- de_DE
- es_AR
- es_BO
- fr_FR
- ga_IE
- he_IL
- hu_HU
- id_ID
- it_IT
- ja_JP
- ko_KR
- mk_MK
- nb_NO
- nl_NL
- pl_PL
- pt_BR
- ru_RU
- tr_TR
- uk_UA
- zh_CN

Localization is done by volunteers for each locale. The Ghostty project
is extremely grateful to the volunteers who have contributed their time
to localize Ghostty. If you would like to localize Ghostty to your locale,
please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` documentation for instructions.

### GTK: FreeBSD Support

PRs: GH-7606

The Ghostty GTK application now supports FreeBSD. This work was driven
almost completely by a single community member, who did the hard work of
submitting patches to all our dependencies to support FreeBSD, updating
our build scripts, and assisting with automated testing to ensure Ghostty
remains functional on FreeBSD.

In addition to building and running properly on FreeBSD, the community
is developing a FreeBSD port to make installation easier. We will update
the installation documentation when that port is available.

### GTK: Full, Leak-free Rewrite

PRs: GH-7961, [`gtk-ng` PRs](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pulls?page=4&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+gtk-ng)

We've rewritten the entire GTK application from the ground up using the
full [GObject type system](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/concepts.html).
Throughout the process, we tested every feature with [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/)
to check for memory leaks, undefined memory access, use-after-free, and more.

See the original PR for full motivations, but the result is a more stable,
modern GTK application that is much more maintainable for contributors.

The GTK application in 1.1.3 had some known memory leaks that required
Ghostty to be restarted after very extended periods of time. Terminals
are usually never closed for many developers and no application should require
restarts. The GTK application now is completely stable and tip users
have reported no issues keeping it running for weeks at a time.

This doesn't just benefit GTK users: as a result of this work, we now
run all Ghostty unit tests under Valgrind for every commit (GH-8309).
Over 90% of our unit tests cover cross-platform code, so this helps
ensure that all of Ghostty is more stable and reliable.

<Note>
  Valgrind is only able to detect memory issues in executed code paths. We
  exercised every possible GUI interaction, but we didn't exercise every
  possible code path in Ghostty.
</Note>

## System Requirements

**macOS:** The minimum required macOS version for Ghostty 1.2 remains
unchanged (macOS 13 Ventura). Ghostty is now compatible with macOS 26 (Tahoe).

**GTK:** Ghostty 1.2 requires **GTK 4.14** and **libadwaita 1.5**. This
aligns with our [GTK/Adwaita version policy](/docs/linux/#supported-gtkadwaita-versions).
Systems with older GTK or Adwaita versions can workaround this requirement
by using an older version of Ghostty or a community-maintained snap or
flatpak package.

## Breaking Changes

- GTK: libadwaita is now required. We've
  [warned that this was coming](/docs/install/release-notes/1-1-0#gtk:-forcing-a-dependency-on-libadwaita)
  since the 1.1.0 release notes and our motivations are well explained in
  the prior link. Please read that carefully before reacting! We put out a
  call for feedback from the community and discussed this decision at length.
  We shipped features addressing those concerns such as our SSD support, first
  class CSS styling, and more.
- GTK: The minimum required OpenGL version is now 4.3. This was required
  to improve performance, fix some rendering bugs more easily, and make our
  OpenGL backend more maintainable. OpenGL 4.3 was released in 2012, so this is
  still over a decade old. GH-7620
- Bundled themes have been updated to
  [release-20250915-154825-b4500fc](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/releases/tag/release-20250915-154825-b4500fc).
  Since the themes are managed upstream, this may include theme renames
  and color changes. **If your theme that was working in 1.1.3 stops working
  when updating to 1.2, please check the linked release to verify your theme
  name.**
- The `dlig` font feature is now disabled by default. This may result in
  ligatures that were previously working to no longer work. This was always
  formally specified as a "discretionary ligature" feature, meaning that it
  should be opt-in. The more common `calt` (contextual ligature) feature remains
  on by default. You can re-enable this feature with the `font-features` config.
  GH-8164

### Deprecations

The list below contains deprecations that remain compatible today through
a compatibility layer, but may break in a future release if they are
ignored:

- `adw-toolbar-style` has been renamed to `gtk-toolbar-style`.
- `gtk-tabs-location=hidden` is replaced with `window-show-tab-bar=never`.
- `selection-invert-fg-bg` is replaced with
  `selection-foreground=cell-background` and
  `selection-background=cell-foreground`. GH-5219
- `cursor-invert-fg-bg` is replaced with
  `cursor-color=cell-foreground` and
  `cursor-text=cell-background`. GH-5219

There is no set timeline to remove these deprecations, but we recommend
adapting to the new configurations sooner rather than later to avoid
any possible disruptions in the future.

<Note>
  The deprecations above will continue to work without any visible warnings. We
  plan to augment our GUI to show warnings about the configuration in a future
  release.

## Full Changelog

[Full list of closed issues on GitHub](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/milestone/5?closed=1).

In each section, we try to sort improvements before bug fixes.

- Commands through `-e` no longer are run wrapped with `/bin/sh`
  and instead are executed directly. GH-7032
- Add a new command palette feature to macOS and GTK that allows
  executing most keybind actions even if they aren't bound. GH-7153 GH-7156
- Directional `goto_split` on both macOS and GTK navigates to the nearest
  split in that direction from the top-left corner of the current split.
  We call this "spatial navigation" and it results in more intuitive split
  navigation. GH-574
- The `equalize_splits` keybind action now produces more expected, pleasing
  results when multiple splits are oriented in the same direction. GH-7710
- New opt-in shell integration features `ssh-terminfo` and `ssh-env`
  improve the experience of using Ghostty over SSH. GH-7608
- Cursor information is now available to custom shaders, enabling custom
  shaders to do things such as draw cool animations for cursor movement.
  GH-7648
- A new CLI command `+edit-config` will open the Ghostty configuration
  in your configured terminal `$EDITOR`. GH-7668
- Add a new keybind `prompt_surface_title` that can be used to change

  to execute a command via the shell (default) or directly via
  `exec`. GH-7032
- config: copy on right click with `right-click-action = copy`. GH-4404
- config: `background-image` can be used to set a background image for
  the terminal. This currently applies to each terminal, not to windows.

  when typing. GH-7394
- config: new `link-previews` option determines when URL previews in the
  bottom of windows appear. GH-7831
- config: new `background-opacity-cells` applies the `background-opacity`
  configuration to explicit cell backgrounds (e.g. from the running program).
  GH-7913
- config: new `faint-opacity` configures the cell opacity to use for
  cells marked as faint by the terminal program. GH-8472
- config: new `right-click-action` option can configure the behavior when
  the right mouse button is clicked. GH-8254
- cli: pressing `enter` in `+list-themes` now shows help text on
  how to configure the theme. GH-4731
- cli: `+list-themes` now has a flag to filter light and dark themes. GH-7235
- cli: add theme filtering to `+list-themes`. GH-8082

- custom shaders can now be reloaded at runtime. GH-7620
- custom shaders blend properly with the background color. GH-7620
- holding the mouse above or below the window while clicking now
  scrolls the viewport without having to jiggle the mouse. GH-4422
- shell-integration: now uses a single `GHOSTTY_SHELL_INTEGRATION_FEATURES`
  env var to specify enabled features instead of multiple env vars. GH-6871
- shell-integration/elvish: use the `kitty-shell-cwd://` scheme for OSC 7
  reporting so we don't have to encode it. GH-7033
- Split and tab navigation keybinds such as `goto_split` and `next_tab`
  support `performable`. GH-7680
- font: improve the performance of glyph hashing for caching yielding
  a roughly 5% speed in synthetic stress tests. GH-7677

  specifically to the CLI. GH-7481
- The config `adjust-cursor-thickness` now works with `cursor-style=underline`.
  GH-7732
- Resolve issue when pressing `backspace` with preedit text (such as
  when using an IME). GH-5728
- config: `keybind=` (blank) restores default keybindings, behaving
  like other `<key>=` blank values. GH-5936
- config: `palette` configuration now supports whitespace between
  the palette number and color. GH-5921
- config: All configurations that take a list of colors (e.g.
  `macos-icon-ghost-color`) support spaces after commas. GH-5918
- the `copy_url_to_clipboard` keybind action works properly with OSC 8
  hyperlinks. GH-7499
- font: fallback fonts sizes are automatically adjusted to more closely match
  the primary font size visually. GH-7840
- font: Support new sprites: U+1CC00 to U+1CCFF, U+1CE00 to U+1CEFF, U+2500
  to U+25FF, U+1CE00 to U+1CEFF, U+1FB00 to U+1FBFF. GH-7755 GH-7761
- font: U+25E4 and U+25E2 (geometric shapes) are now rasterized
  with the built-in sprite font. GH-3344
- font: corner pieces of Geometric Shapes are now rasterized with
  the built-in sprite font. GH-7562
- font: glyph constraint logic dramatically improved, resulting in things like
  Nerd Font icons appearing more correctly. GH-7809
- input: for keyboards that support it, the `copy` and `paste` physical
  keys now bind by default to `copy_to_clipboard` and `paste_from_clipboard`,
  respectively. GH-8586
- input: the default `copy_to_clipboard` bindings are marked as performable,
  meaning the key will be encoded to the pty if there is no text to copy.
  This allows TUIs to capture this. GH-8504
- input: mouse scrollwheel mapping to mouse events was modified to
  better match other terminal emulators. GH-6052
- input: `ctrl+<ASCII>` works across a wider variety of keyboard layouts.
  GH-7309

  GH-8536.
- gracefully handle the case that the `exec` syscall fails when starting the
  terminal command. GH-7793

  select an extra line or character. GH-7444
- fix file path regular expression to require at least one slash. GH-7355
- fix a crash when reflowing a grapheme with a spacer head in a specific
  location. GH-7537

- Fix memory leak each time the modifier was held to search for links. GH-7998
- Fix crashes when our bitmap allocator had exactly 64 chunks allocated. GH-8276
- Fix possible use-after-free in font atlas error paths. There are no known
  cases of this being exercised in the wild. GH-8249
- Fix possible crashes in some internal OOM conditions where growing the
  backing buffer was not implemented properly. GH-8277
- Fix undefined memory access in OSC parser that could lead to crashes. GH-8307

  This may rename existing themes. If your theme stops working, please check
  to see if the theme was renamed. The renames are done upstream so there
  isn't any way for us to avoid them.
- inspector: fix display of fractional pixel sizes. GH-8179
- contrib/vim: fix syntax highlighting of the config in scratch buffers. GH-7119

### Terminal Capabilities

This section covers the changes to terminal emulation and other capabilities
exposed to applications running inside the terminal.

Ghostty remains focused
on terminal emulator compatibility so the changes in Ghostty 1.2 only add
or improve compatibility with features in other terminal emulators. In future
versions of Ghostty, we plan to add new Ghostty-specific features that
application developers can take advantage of.

- vt: add support for mode 47. GH-7443
- vt: add support for mode 1048. GH-7473
- vt: parse more ConEmu OSC 9 sequences. The only ConEmu OSC 9 sequence that
  Ghostty reacts to is the `9;4` progress bar sequence. The remainder are
  parsed but ignored. GH-8410
- vt: Significant improvements in feature support and compatibility of
  color operations with xterm. Specifically OSC 4, 5, 10-19, 104, 105, and
  110-119. This adds new sequence support in addition to fixing compatibility
  of previously supported color operations. GH-8590
- vt: Indicate support for OSC 52 in the primary DA report. GH-7725
- vt: OSC 4/104 allow multiple color specifications. GH-7402
- vt: Allow SGR sequences to contain up to 24 parameters, fixing some
  Kakoune themes. GH-8417
- vt: OSC 52 can empty the current clipboard by sending an empty string. GH-8018
- vt: `XTGETTCAP` works properly for lowercase hex characters. GH-7229
- vt: Kitty image protocol supports delete by range operations. GH-5957
- vt: Fix aspect ratio issues with some images using the Kitty image
  protocol. GH-6673
- vt: Kitty image protocol should accept commands with no control data. GH-7023
- vt: don't force Kitty images to a grid size. GH-7367
- vt: fix a variety of alt screen edge cases for mode 47, 1047, and 1049 to
  better match xterm behavior. I don't know any real programs that exercised
  these bugs, but its good hygiene. GH-7471
- vt: clear hyperlink state when switching between normal and alt screen.
  GH-7471
- vt: `ctrl+esc` now produces the proper Kitty keyboard encoding. GH-7000
- vt: clear correct row on index (`\n`) operation in certain edge cases.
  This fixes a misrender that could happen with the vim status line
  in certain scenarios. GH-7093
- vt: clicking on an unfocused window no longer encodes a mouse event. GH-2595
- vt: fix undefined memory access on certain incomplete escape sequences.
  GH-8007
- vt: OSC 9 notifications can contain single character messages. GH-8396
- vt: when VS15 makes a default wide character narrow, the cursor moves back
  one cell. GH-8538

### macOS

- macOS: Support macOS 26 (Tahoe).
- macOS: You can now undo and redo closing any type of terminal (window, tab,
  or split). We keep recently closed terminals in memory for a configurable
  amount of time (default 10 seconds) so you can recover them if you close
  them by accident. GH-7535
- macOS: Read-only accessibility API integration allows screen readers
  to read Ghostty's structure and contents. This is also useful for AI software
  to read Ghostty's contents. This requires accessibility permissions, so it is
  opt-in. GH-7601
- macOS: Integration with App Intents enables Ghostty to be automated with
  Apple Shortcuts. GH-7634
- macOS: Bell implementation. By default, the bell will bounce the dock icon
  and put a bell emoji in the title. This is cleared when the terminal is
  focused or on any input. The bell does not make any audio sounds. These
  can all be disabled with `bell-features`. GH-7099
- macOS: Scripts executed from Finder or dropped onto the dock now execute
  via the login shell and sending `<filepath>; exit` via stdin. This is how
  the built-in Terminal and other terminals work to allow loading your
  login scripts. GH-7647
- macOS: Custom icons are now persisted while Ghostty is not running. GH-8230
- macOS: Display a native GUI progress bar for `OSC 9;4` progress bar sequences.
  GH-8477
- macOS: Add `bring_all_to_front` keybind action to bring all
  Ghostty windows to the front. GH-4704
- macOS: Add `reset_window_size` keybind action to reset the window
  size to its initial configured size. GH-6038
- macOS: Add `check_for_update` keybind action. GH-7235
- macOS: Add "Return to Default Size" menu item. GH-1328
- macOS: `macos-hidden` configuration will hide Ghostty from the
  dock and tab menu. GH-4538
- macOS: Clicking links now uses the `NSWorkspace` API rather than
  the `open` command. This preserves the source application (Ghostty)
  which other programs can now use to change their behavior if
  desired. GH-5256
- macOS: New config `macos-window-buttons` to hide the traffic light
  buttons. GH-7504
- macOS: New option `padded-notch` for the existing `macos-non-native-fullscreen`
  configuration to put the non-native fullscreen window below the notch
  but still hide the menu bar. GH-5750
- macOS: New keybind action and menu item `toggle_window_float_on_top` to
  have a specific terminal window float above all other windows even when
  unfocused. GH-7237
- macOS: Equalize splits now works in the quick terminal. GH-7480
- macOS: `quick-terminal-position=center` now supports resize while retaining
  the center position. GH-8398
- macOS: Scripts executed from Finder or dropped onto the dock always
  require manual confirmation to run. GH-8442
- macOS: The reset zoom button for splits is now visible with titlebar tabs
  and a single tab. GH-7502
- macOS: `window-save-state` now saves terminal titles. GH-7938
- macOS: `Cmd+h` (macOS hide window) no longer sends `h` if attempting to
  hide the last visible window. GH-5929
- macOS: `maximize` configuration now works on macOS. GH-5928
- macOS: Improve key input handling speed by about 10x. GH-7121
- macOS: Differentiate between closing a tab vs a window when pressing the
  red traffic light. GH-7618
- macOS: Title text is vertically centered with `macos-titlebar-style=tabs`.
  GH-5777
- macOS: Ghostty launched via the CLI now comes to the front. GH-8546
- macOS: focus no longer goes to the first split when toggling
  non-native fullscreen. GH-6999
- macOS: `cmd+.` can now be bound. GH-6909
- macOS: font glyphs constrained to a terminal cell now appear sharper. GH-6914
- macOS: the `close_window` keybind action now works. GH-7003
- macOS: quick terminal can appear and disappear more reliably
  on fullscreen spaces. GH-7070
- macOS: selection off the left edge of the window no longer
  scrolls up by one line. GH-7071
- macOS: New windows created with `macos-titlebar-style=hidden` now cascade
  their position like other windows. GH-7567
- macOS: Key input that clears preedit without text shouldn't encode to pty.
  GH-7226
- macOS: keyboard shortcuts now work properly with the "Dvorak - QWERTY
  ⌘" macOS keyboard layout. GH-7315
- macOS: Round up fractional mouse scroll events, making mice with scroll
  wheels feel more usable. GH-7185
- macOS: All split directions are now available in the menubar and
  context menus. GH-5807
- macOS: Setting the pwd with OSC 7 now works with macOS's "Private Wi-Fi
  Address" feature. GH-7029
- macOS: Resize overlay now uses language-neutral `w x h` format
  and omits units. GH-7142
- macOS: "Services -> New Ghostty Window/Tab Here" now works with files.
  GH-7286
- macOS: Reliably retain focus when using non-native fullscreen. GH-7279
- macOS: Dictation now streams pending text in real-time. GH-8490
- macOS: Dictation icon properly shows the language picker. GH-8490
- macOS: Dictation icon now properly follows the text as it streams. GH-8490
- macOS: Fix memory leak that would retain memory of the last closed
  surface (only one at a time). GH-7507
- macOS: Fix memory leak where we failed to free CoreText font features. GH-7770
- macOS: Fix memory leak in fallback discovery font descriptors. GH-7770
- macOS: Fix memory leak for ObjC blocks. GH-7770
- macOS: Fix crash that would occur if non-native fullscreen and
  `fullscreen = true` were both set. GH-7277
- macOS: If `title` is set, the title is set on the window on load,
  allowing window managers to see the title sooner. GH-6056
- macOS: Any keypress with `cmd` pressed is not encoded for legacy
  key encoding. GH-6057
- macOS: Invoking `new_tab` in any way within the quick terminal now
  shows a helpful error rather than creating a new window. Tabs in the
  quick terminal will be supported in a future release. GH-5939
- macOS: Closing non-native fullscreen windows no properly restores
  the menu bar. GH-7525
- macOS: Dismiss any notifications on window focus. GH-7531
- macOS: Dismiss any notifications on window close. GH-7531
- macOS: Dismiss any notifications of an already-focused window after
  a few seconds. GH-7531
- font/coretext: improve font search sorting to be more consistent. GH-7483
- man pages now mention macOS-specific configuration path. GH-5938

### GTK (Linux, FreeBSD)

- GTK: Support for FreeBSD. This work was all driven by a single community
  member and we are very grateful for their contributions. GH-7606
- GTK: New icon that matches a wider variety of desktop environments
  stylistically. This is never going to be perfect due to the diversity of
  the Linux/BSD ecosystems, but the new icon is a big improvement and makes
  the app feel less macOS-centric. GH-8038
- GTK: Configuration can be reloaded by sending `SIGUSR2` to Ghostty. GH-7759
- GTK: A new `gtk-titlebar-style=tabs` puts the tabs into the titlebar
  of windows. GH-8166
- GTK: The quick terminal now works on Linux under Wayland and the
  `wlr-layer-shell` protocol. GH-4624
- GTK: `global:` keybinds now work whenever XDG desktop portal
  is available (almost all desktop environments). GH-6051
- GTK: Display a native GUI progress bar for `OSC 9;4` progress bar sequences,
  such as those emitted by systemd. GH-7975
- GTK: Audio bell support (default off) can be enabled with
  `bell-features=audio` and setting `bell-audio-path` and
  `bell-audio-volume`. GH-5326
- GTK: Install DBus and Systemd activation services for faster startup. GH-7433
- GTK: OpenGL renderer now supports linear blending for more correct
  color blending. GH-7620
- GTK: Register the `X-KDE-Shortcut` key so that a shortcut can be registered
  on KDE to open Ghostty. GH-7673
- GTK: Dynamically choose between `io_uring` and `epoll` for the
  async API on Linux. Previously, this was hardcoded to `io_uring`
  and epoll-only systems had to build from source. GH-5916
- GTK: New config `async-backend` can be set to `epoll` to force using
  epoll instead of io_uring on Linux. This can be useful on kernels where
  iowait reporting is broken. GH-5916
- GTK: New config `window-show-tab-bar` customizes when the tab bar
  is visible. GH-5590
- GTK: New config `quick-terminal-keyboard-interactivity` to specifically
  customize the keyboard interactivity setting on Wayland. GH-7477
- GTK: New keybind action `show_gtk_inspector` to show the GTK inspector
  since terminal keybinds usually clobber the GTK default. GH-7468
- GTK: The new tab button now has a dropdown menu to create new splits. GH-7127
- GTK: A new "remember choice" toggle is added to the clipboard confirmation
  dialog. GH-6783
- GTK: A new native GUI element is used to show when a command exits
  improperly or while `wait-after-command` is set. GH-7836
- GTK: Support on-screen keyboards. GH-7987
- GTK: If `title` is set, windows are initialized with the title immediately,
  rather than after the surface is initialized. This lets window managers
  read and use this value. GH-8535
- GTK: Show a native GUI element if the OpenGL renderer fails to initialize
  rather than a blank window. GH-8390
- GTK: Escape `(` and `)` when dropping filepaths onto the terminal. GH-6922
- GTK: `copy-on-select=clipboard` no longer causes toast spam while
  selecting. The copy only happens when the mouse is released. GH-4800
- GTK: All split directions are now available in the menubar and
  context menus. GH-5779
- GTK: Windows do not request close confirmation for `wait-after-command`.
  GH-7500
- GTK: When server-side decorations are used, remove the `solid-csd`
  CSS class from windows that resulted in a visible border. GH-8127
- GTK: Fix an issue where the window would sometimes become blank
  and not close after the last tab was closed. GH-5837
- GTK: Resize overlay now uses language-neutral `w x h` format
  and omits units. GH-6013
- GTK: Clean up surface cgroup properly on close. GH-6766
- GTK: Reduce flickering/stretching on resize for OpenGL. GH-7155
- GTK: Detect `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR` in more installation environments.
  GH-6814
- GTK: Fix cases where `xdg-open` calls would leave defunct processes. GH-7657
  GTK/X11: Fix blur regions when using > 200% scaling. GH-6978
- font/freetype: true bitmap fonts are now supported. GH-8512
- font/freetype: fix possible crashes when using a font with no SFNT tables.
  GH-8483
- font/freetype: error when loading SVG glyphs, since we don't support them
  anyways. GH-6824
- font/freetype: fix data races that could cause crashes in rare scenarios.
  GH-7238
- font/freetype: convert more non-UTF-8 encodings of font names to UTF-8.
  GH-8204
- packaging: experimental snap packaging is now tested in CI. The
  published snap image is maintained by an external maintainer for now.
  GH-3931

### Changes for Package Maintainers

- We now generate source tarballs with some preprocessed files as is
  standard with many source tarballs (e.g. converting parser `.y` to `.c`).
  For Ghostty, we preprocess Blueprint `ui` to `xml` files, translations,
  and GTK resource files. This allows Ghostty to be built on older platforms
  without access to newer build tools. **Packagers should use the source
  tarball, not the Git checkout. The `PACKAGING.md` documentation has been
  updated with this information.** GH-6800

- The GLFW apprt has been deleted. This was never a supported apprt and
  was only used for development and testing. We warned against packaging GLFW
  in our `PACKAGING.md` documentation. This is now gone because we don't need
  it for development or testing anymore. GH-7815

- The "tip" releases do not overwrite previously released tips with the
  same commit. This ensures that checksums remain stable once a release
  is cut. For packagers that provide tip packages, this should improve
  security and compatibility with tooling. Tip releases have always been
  signed. GH-8549

#### Flatpak/Snap Update

Ghostty 1.2 now comes with a configuration to build for Flatpak as well as
Snap. We test this for every commit in CI and strive to keep Ghostty
working via these distribution methods. However, we do not officially
provide or maintain Flatpak or Snap packages, yet.

This is major progress: Ghostty 1.1.x didn't work at all as a Flatpak
or Snap package without patches, and the official project made no guarantees
about maintaining these packages. Now, we at least build and test on these
platforms, while still falling short of official distribution.

Our major blocker for official distribution is **maintainer interest**
and release automation. None of the current Ghostty maintainers main the
Snap or Flatpak builds of Ghostty, and we don't feel confident in our
ability to maintain these packages long term. If you are interested in
helping maintain the Flatpak or Snap packages of Ghostty, please join
Discord and message us in `#packaging`.

## Roadmap

Ghostty 1.3 will continue the focus of making Ghostty the
["best existing terminal emulator"](https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-1-0-reflection)
by shipping the last remaining major missing features to achieve
parity with other popular terminal emulators. Namely, we plan on shipping
scrollback search and scrollbars for 1.3, at a minimum.[^1]

The primary focus of Ghostty 1.3 will be on desktop application features
(of which scrollback search and scrollbars are a part). The core terminal
emulation features of Ghostty have already proven to be very feature
rich and stable. However, we plan on continuing to expand our VT feature
support, such as adopting new experimental protocols that have been recently
released into the ecosystem by others.

To answer common requests, **Windows** and **libghostty as a
standalone library** are not planned for Ghostty 1.3. These remain part
of the long term roadmap, but we want to focus on our existing platforms
and desktop applications first.

### Moving to a March/September Release Cycle

Ghostty will move to a 6-month release cycle for major/minor releases,
with the next minor release (1.3.0) planned for March 2026. A March/September
release cycle aligns well with many major Linux distributions and macOS.
Patch releases (e.g. 1.2.1) will be made as needed on an unscheduled basis.

This is a relatively long release cycle for modern applications, but
lets the development team focus on large, impactful features with enough
time to stabilize in tip releases. For packagers, it avoids the churn of
packaging new releases frequently. And the alignment with major OS releases
lets us ensure we ship major releases that work well on new OS versions.

For users who are interested in more frequent updates, we recommend using
the [`tip` release channel](/docs/config/reference#auto-update-channel) on macOS or
[building from source](/docs/install/release-notes/1-1-0#roadmap) frequently on Linux.
We have thousands of nightly users (thank you for testing!) and the entire
maintainer team works hard to keep tip releases stable. For the entire 1.1
to 1.2 development cycle, I can't remember tip releases ever being broken
for daily use.

[^1]:
    "Parity" here is used loosely to describe the most popular, frequently
    used features of other terminal emulators. There is a long tail of features
    we'll likely never fully implement (and vice versa for our features).

[^2]:
    I didn't do a full survey of this, but I couldn't find any other
    terminal emulator that supported both OSC 9 notifications, OSC 777 notifications,
    _and_ OSC `9;4` progress bars.
