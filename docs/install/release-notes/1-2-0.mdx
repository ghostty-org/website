### New App Icons

PRs: GH-7638 GH-8038

On macOS, Ghostty 1.2 ships with a new macOS Tahoe compatible icon shown
below. This icon is built with the new Icon Composer application and allows
the icon to work with all of the new macOS light, dark, translucent, and
custom tinting styles.

<p align="center">
  <a href="/images/1-2-0/macos.png" target="_blank">
    <img
      src="/images/1-2-0/macos.png"
      width="160"
      style={{ maxWidth: "50%", margin: "10px" }}
    />
  </a>
</p>

On GTK (Linux and FreeBSD), Ghostty 1.2 ships with a new icon that better
matches _many_ desktop environments. We chose to align with the GNOME styling
since that is common and doesn't generally look out of place in most
environments.

<p align="center">
  <a href="/images/1-2-0/gnome.png" target="_blank">
    <img
      src="/images/1-2-0/gnome.png"
      width="200"
      style={{ maxWidth: "50%", margin: "10px" }}
    />
  </a>
</p>

<Note>
  It's impossible to make a perfect, globally consistent icon for the Linux and
  BSD ecosystem due to the diversity of desktop environments. We believe this
  icon looks better in more environments than the prior icon, and avoids some
  negative reactions that the prior icon demonstrated a macOS-centric point of
  view.
</Note>

### Command Palette

PRs: GH-7153 GH-7156

Ghostty now has a command palette that can invoke most keybind actions,
such as creating new terminals, moving focus, changing text selection,
copy and paste, etc.

The command palette is bound by default to `ctrl+shift+p` on GTK and
`cmd+shift+p` on macOS. This can be rebound to any keybind using the
`toggle_command_palette` keybind action. The command palette is also available
via the menubar on both macOS and GTK.

TODO: Screenshot

The command palette exposes almost every available keybind. As new keybind
actions are added to Ghostty, they will be automatically available in the
command palette as well. This has some immediate benefits, namely that you can
access keybind actions even if they aren't bound to a keybind. This is useful
for infrequently used actions.

For example, I personally find myself using the `move_tab` action via the
command palette frequently, but not frequently enough to justify binding it.

In future versions of Ghostty, we'll continue to expand the features that
are available in the command palette. For example, we're working on a new
terminal sequence specification that would allow terminal programs to expose
any of their actions directly in the command palette (e.g. imagine Neovim
commands being fully available in the command palette).

### Quick Terminal Size

PRs: GH-2384

A new configuration `quick-terminal-size` can now configure the default size
of the quick terminal. This was one of the most highly requested features.

The `quick-terminal-size` configuration supports both percentage and pixel
size. If you specify only one value, it specifies the size of the primary
axis (depending on the location). If you specify two values, then the second
value is the secondary axis. The example below illustrates:

```
# Percentage, primary axis only
quick-terminal-size = 25%

# Pixels work too, primary axis only
quick-terminal-size = 600px

# Two values specify primary and secondary axis
quick-terminal-size = 25%,75%

# You can also mix units
quick-terminal-size = 300px,80%
```

The _primary axis_ is defined by the `quick-terminal-position` configuration.
For the `top` and `bottom` values, the primary axis is the height. For
the `left` and `right` values, the primary axis is the width. For `center`,
it depends on your monitor orientation: it is height for landscape and width for
portrait.

Beyond simply specifying the size, the quick terminal is now resizable at
runtime and will remember that size for the duration that Ghostty is running.
In prior versions, the size was fixed, which caused real problems depending
on monitor size and resolution.

### Terminal Background Images

PRs: GH-3645

You can now specify a background image for your terminal using the
`background-image` configuration. This comes with a set of other
configurations so that the image appears just how you'd like it:
`background-image-opacity`, `background-image-position`,
`background-image-fit`, and `background-image-repeat`.

TODO: Screenshot

<Warning>
  In Ghostty 1.2.0, the background image is duplicated in VRAM for each
  terminal. For sufficiently large images and many terminals, this can lead to a
  large increase in memory usage (specifically VRAM). A future Ghostty release
  will share image textures across terminals to avoid this issue.
</Warning>

### Terminal Bell

PRs: GH-7099, GH-5326, GH-7087, GH-7101, GH-7118, GH-7148, GH-7842, GH-7533

Ghostty on both macOS and GTK support the terminal bell (ASCII `BEL` or
`0x07`). Ghostty's behavior when the bell is rung can be customized using
the `bell-features` configuration. We've shipped with defaults which we believe
are the least intrusive while still being useful, and more intrusive optional
features can be set with `bell-features`.

On macOS, the bell by default will put the bell emoji (ðŸ””) in the title of
the terminal, will bounce the dock icon once, and will put a badge on the
Ghostty icon visible in the dock and application switcher. No audio will be
played.

On GTK, the bell by default will put the bell emoji (ðŸ””) in the title of
the terminal and will mark the window as requesting attention. The exact
behavior of "requesting attention" is determined by the window manager or
desktop environment. No audio will be played.

GTK also supports an audio bell feature which is off by default. This can be
enabled with `bell-features=audio`. You can even specify custom audio to
play using the `bell-audio-path` configuration.

GTK also supports a border flashing animation that can be enabled with
`bell-features=border`. This is similar to the "visual bell" feature provided
by other terminal emulators.

A future version of Ghostty will bring parity to macOS with all the bell
features.

### macOS: Undo/Redo Close

PRs: GH-7535

All operations that close a terminal now support undo and redo using
standard macOS keybinds (`Cmd+Z` and `Cmd+Shift+Z`, but can be rebound).
This includes closing a split, closing a tab, closing a window, closing
all windows, closing other tabs, etc.

Undo/redo works by keeping recently closed terminals running but hidden
for a configurable amount of time (by default 10 seconds). During this time,
you can undo the close and the terminal will be reopened in the same location
as before. Since the terminal was always running, your exact terminal state
is restored.

The time that a terminal can be undone can be configured with the
`undo-timeout` configuration.

In future versions of Ghostty we plan to expand the GUI interactions
that can be undone and redone, such as resizing splits, moving tabs, etc.

### GTK: Quick Terminal

PRs: GH-4624

The quick terminal is now supported on Linux while running on Wayland
with access to the
[widely supported `wlr-layer-shell` protocol](https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1#compositor-support).
The quick terminal has been available on macOS since Ghostty 1.0.

As a reminder, the "quick terminal" is the feature of Ghostty where a
singleton window of a terminal can be shown and hidden with a single
hotkey bound to `toggle_quick_terminal` (usually a global hotkey that
works even when Ghostty isn't focused). This is sometimes referred to
as a "dropdown terminal" or a "DOOM-style terminal."

The quick terminal on Linux fully supports tabs and splits.

TODO: Screenshot

### GTK: Global Keybinds

PRs: GH-6051

The GTK application now supports global keybinds, keybinds that
work even while Ghostty is not the focused application. These keybinds
are defined with the `global:` prefix in the Ghostty configuration.

Global keybinds require a functional XDG desktop portal installed on your
system. Other parts of Ghostty already rely on XDG desktop portal, so it likely
already exists. If not, its usually a single well-supported package away (plus
a restart).

Global keybinds support any keybind action but are particularly well
suited when paired with features such as `toggle_quick_terminal`, which is
now [also supported on GTK](#gtk:-quick-terminal).

### GTK: Localization (Work-in-Progress)

PRs: GH-6004 plus too many to list for each locale.

Preliminary support for localization of the GTK application has been added.
Currently, only GTK GUI elements are translated. Localization support for
macOS and other parts of Ghostty will arrive in future releases.

Ghostty 1.2 has complete localization for GUI elements for the following
locales:

- bg_BG
- ca_ES
- de_DE
- es_AR
- es_BO
- fr_FR
- ga_IE
- id_ID
- ja_JP
- ko_KR
- mk_MK
- nb_NO
- nl_NL
- pl_PL
- pt_BR
- ru_RU
- tr_TR
- uk_UA
- zh_CN

Localization is done by volunteers for each locale. The Ghostty project
is extremely grateful to the volunteers who have contributed their time
to localize Ghostty. If you would like to localize Ghostty to your locale,
please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` documentation for instructions.

### GTK: FreeBSD Support

PRs: GH-7606

The Ghostty GTK application now supports FreeBSD. This work was driven
almost completely by a single community member, who did the hard work of
submitting patches to all our dependencies to support FreeBSD, updating
our build scripts, and assisting with automated testing to ensure Ghostty
remains functional on FreeBSD.

In addition to building and running properly on FreeBSD, the community
is developing a FreeBSD port to make installation easier. We will update
the installation documentation when that port is available.

## System Requirements

**macOS:** The minimum required macOS version for Ghostty 1.2 remains
unchanged (macOS 13 Ventura). Ghostty is now compatible with macOS 26 (Tahoe).

**GTK:** Ghostty 1.2 requires **GTK 4.14** and **libadwaita 1.5**. This
aligns with our [GTK/Adwaita version policy](/docs/linux/#supported-gtkadwaita-versions).
Systems with older GTK or Adwaita versions can workaround this requirement
by using an older version of Ghostty or a community-maintained snap or
flatpak package.

## Breaking Changes

- GTK: libadwaita is now required. We've
  [warned that this was coming](/docs/install/release-notes/1-1-0#gtk:-forcing-a-dependency-on-libadwaita)
  since the 1.1.0 release notes and our motivations are well explained in
  the prior link. Please read that carefully before reacting! We put out a
  call for feedback from the community and discussed this decision at length.
  We shipped features addressing those concerns such as our SSD support, first
  class CSS styling, and more.
- GTK: The minimum required OpenGL version is now 4.3. This was required
  to improve performance, fix some rendering bugs more easily, and make our
  OpenGL backend more maintainable. OpenGL 4.3 was released in 2012, so this is
  still over a decade old. GH-7620
- The `dlig` font feature is now disabled by default. This may result in
  ligatures that were previously working to no longer work. This was always
  formally specified as a "discretionary ligature" feature, meaning that it
  should be opt-in. The more common `calt` (contextual ligature) feature remains
  on by default. You can reenable this feature with the `font-features` config.
  GH-8164

### Deprecations

The list below contains deprecations that remain compatible today through
a compatibility layer, but may break in a future release if they are
ignored:

- `adw-toolbar-style` has been renamed to `gtk-toolbar-style`.
- `gtk-tabs-location=hidden` is replaced with `window-show-tab-bar=never`.
- `selection-invert-fg-bg` is replaced with
  `selection-foreground=cell-background` and
  `selection-background=cell-foreground`. GH-5219
- `cursor-invert-fg-bg` is replaced with
  `cursor-color=cell-foreground` and
  `cursor-text=cell-background`. GH-5219

There is no set timeline to remove these deprecations, but we recommend
adapting to the new configurations sooner rather than later to avoid
any possible disruptions in the future.

<Note>
  The deprecations above will continue to work without any visible warnings. We
  plan to augment our GUI to show warnings about the configuration in a future
  release.

### macOS

- macOS: Support macOS 26 (Tahoe).
- macOS: You can now undo and redo closing any type of terminal (window, tab,
  or split). We keep recently closed terminals in memory for a configurable
  amount of time (default 10 seconds) so you can recover them if you close
  them by accident. GH-7535
- macOS: Read-only accessibility API integration allows screen readers
  to read Ghostty's structure and contents. This is also useful for AI software
  to read Ghostty's contents. This requires accessibility permissions, so it is
  opt-in. GH-7601
- macOS: Integration with App Intents enables Ghostty to be automated with
  Apple Shortcuts. GH-7634
- macOS: Bell implementation. By default, the bell will bounce the dock icon
  and put a bell emoji in the title. This is cleared when the terminal is
  focused or on any input. The bell does not make any audio sounds. These
  can all be disabled with `bell-features`. GH-7099
- macOS: Scripts executed from Finder or dropped onto the dock now execute
  via the login shell and sending `<filepath>; exit` via stdin. This is how
  the built-in Terminal and other terminals work to allow loading your
  login scripts. GH-7647

  the `open` command. This preserves the source application (Ghostty)
  which other programs can now use to change their behavior if
  desired. GH-5256
- macOS: New config `macos-window-buttons` to hide the traffic light
  buttons. GH-7504
- macOS: New option `padded-notch` for the existing `macos-non-native-fullscreen`
  configuration to put the non-native fullscreen window below the notch
  but still hide the menu bar. GH-5750
- macOS: New keybind action and menu item `toggle_window_float_on_top` to
  have a specific terminal widnow float above all other windows even when
  unfocused. GH-7237
- macOS: Equalize splits now works in the quick terminal. GH-7480
- macOS: `quick-terminal-position=center` now supports resize while retaining
  the center position. GH-8398
- macOS: Scripts executed from Finder or dropped onto the dock always
  require manual confirmation to run. GH-8442
- macOS: The reset zoom button for splits is now visible with titlebar tabs
  and a single tab. GH-7502
- macOS: `window-save-state` now saves terminal titles. GH-7938
- macOS: `Cmd+h` (macOS hide window) no longer sends `h` if attempting to
  hide the last visible window. GH-5929

  non-native fullscreen. GH-6999
- macOS: `cmd+.` can now be bound. GH-6909
- macOS: font glyphs constrained to a terminal cell now appear sharper. GH-6914
- macOS: the `close_window` keybind action now works. GH-7003
- macOS: quick terminal can appear and disappear more reliably
  on fullscreen spaces. GH-7070
- macOS: selection off the left edge of the window no longer
  scrolls up by one line. GH-7071
- macOS: New windows created with `macos-titlebar-style=hidden` now cascade
  their position like other windows. GH-7567
- macOS: Key input that clears preedit without text shouldn't encode to pty.
  GH-7226
- macOS: keyboard shortcuts now work properly with the "Dvorak - QWERTY
  âŒ˜" macOS keyboard layout. GH-7315
- macOS: Round up fractional mouse scroll events, making mice with scroll
  wheels feel more usable. GH-7185

  context menus. GH-5807
- macOS: Setting the pwd with OSC 7 now works with macOS's "Private Wi-Fi
  Address" feature. GH-7029

  surface (only one at a time). GH-7507
- macOS: Fix memory leak where we failed to free CoreText font features. GH-7770
- macOS: Fix memory leak in fallback discovery font descriptors. GH-7770
- macOS: Fix memory leak for ObjC blocks. GH-7770
- macOS: Fix crash that would occur if non-native fullscreen and
  `fullscreen = true` were both set. GH-7277
- macOS: If `title` is set, the title is set on the window on load,
  allowing window managers to see the title sooner. GH-6056
- macOS: Any keypress with `cmd` pressed is not encoded for legacy
  key encoding. GH-6057

### GTK (Linux, FreeBSD)

- GTK: Support for FreeBSD. This work was all driven by a single community
  member and we are very grateful for their contributions. GH-7606
- GTK: New icon that matches a wider variety of desktop environments
  stylistically. This is never going to be perfect due to the diversity of
  the Linux/BSD ecosystems, but the new icon is a big improvement and makes
  the app feel less macOS-centric. GH-8038
- GTK: Configuration can be reloaded by sending `SIGUSR2` to Ghostty. GH-7759
- GTK: A new `gtk-titlebar-style=tabs` puts the tabs into the titlebar
  of windows. GH-8166
- GTK: The quick terminal now works on Linux under Wayland and the
  `wlr-layer-shell` protocol. GH-4624
- GTK: `global:` keybinds now work whenever XDG desktop portal
  is available (almost all desktop environments). GH-6051
- GTK: Display a native GUI progress bar for `OSC 9;4` progress bar sequences,
  such as those emitted by systemd. GH-7975
- GTK: Audio bell support (default off) can be enabled with
  `bell-features=audio` and setting `bell-audio-path` and
  `bell-audio-volume`. GH-5326
- GTK: Install DBus and Systemd activation services for faster startup. GH-7433
- GTK: OpenGL renderer now supports linear blending for more correct
  color blending. GH-7620
- GTK: Register the `X-KDE-Shortcut` key so that a shortcut can be registered
  on KDE to open Ghostty. GH-7673
- GTK: Dynamically choose between `io_uring` and `epoll` for the
  async API on Linux. Previously, this was hardcoded to `io_uring`
  and epoll-only systems had to build from source. GH-5916
- GTK: New config `async-backend` can be set to `epoll` to force using
  epoll instead of io_uring on Linux. This can be useful on kernels where
  iowait reporting is broken. GH-5916
- GTK: New config `window-show-tab-bar` customizes when the tab bar
  is visible. GH-5590
- GTK: New config `quick-terminal-keyboard-interactivity` to specifically
  customize the keyboard interactivity setting on Wayland. GH-7477
- GTK: New keybind action `show_gtk_inspector` to show the GTK inspector
  since terminal keybinds usually clobber the GTK default. GH-7468
- GTK: The new tab button now has a dropdown menu to create new splits. GH-7127
- GTK: A new "remember choice" toggle is added to the clipboard confirmation
  dialog. GH-6783
- GTK: A new native GUI element is used to show when a command exits
  improperly or while `wait-after-command` is set. GH-7836
- GTK: Support on-screen keyboards. GH-7987
- GTK: Show a native GUI element if the OpenGL renderer fails to initialize
  rather than a blank window. GH-8390
- GTK: Escape `(` and `)` when dropping filepaths onto the terminal. GH-6922
- GTK: `copy-on-select=clipboard` no longer causes toast spam while
  selecting. The copy only happens when the mouse is released. GH-4800
- GTK: All split directions are now available in the menubar and
  context menus. GH-5779
- GTK: Windows do not request close confirmation for `wait-after-command`.
  GH-7500
- GTK: When server-side decorations are used, remove the `solid-csd`
  CSS class from windows that resulted in a visible border. GH-8127
- GTK: Fix an issue where the window would sometimes become blank
  and not close after the last tab was closd. GH-5837
- GTK: Resize overlay now uses language-neutral `w x h` format
  and omits units. GH-6013
- GTK: Clean up surface cgroup properly on close. GH-6766
- GTK: Reduce flickering/stretching on resize for OpenGL. GH-7155
- GTK: Detect `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR` in more installation environments.
  GH-6814
- GTK: Fix cases where `xdg-open` calls would leave defunct processes. GH-7657
  GTK/X11: Fix blur regions when using > 200% scaling. GH-6978
- font/freetype: error when loading SVG glyphs, since we don't support them
  anyways. GH-6824
- font/freetype: fix data races that could cause crashes in rare scenarios.
  GH-7238
- font/freetype: convert more non-UTF-8 encodings of font names to UTF-8.
  GH-8204
- packaging: experimental snap packaging is now tested in CI. The
  published snap image is maintained by an external maintainer for now.
  GH-3931

### Changes for Package Maintainers

- We now generate source tarballs with some preprocessed files as is
  standard with many source tarballs (e.g. convertig parser `.y` to `.c`).
  For Ghostty, we preprocess Blueprint `ui` to `xml` files, translations,
  and GTK resource files. This allows Ghostty to built on older platforms
  without access to newer build tools. **Packagers should use the source
  tarball, not the Git checkout. The `PACKAGING.md` documentation has been
  updated with this information.** GH-6800

- The GLFW apprt has been deleted. This was never a supported apprt and
  was only used for development and testing. We warned against packaging GLFW
  in our `PACKAGING.md` documentation. This is now gone because we don't need
  it for development or testing anymore. GH-7815

## Roadmap

Ghostty 1.3 will continue the focus of making Ghostty the
["best existing terminal emulator"](https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-1-0-reflection)
by shipping the last remaining major missing features to achieve
parity with other popular terminal emulators. Namely, we plan on shipping
scrollback search and scrollbars for 1.3, at a minimum.[^1]

The primary focus of Ghostty 1.3 will be on desktop application features
(of which scrollback search and scrollbars are a part). The core terminal
emulation features of Ghostty have already proven to be very feature
rich and stable. However, we plan on continuing to expand our VT feature
support, such as adopting new experimental protocols that have been recently
released into the ecosystem by others.

To answer common requests, **Windows** and **libghostty as a
standalone library** are not planned for Ghostty 1.3. These remain part
of the long term roadmap, but we want to focus on our existing platforms
and desktop applications first.

### Moving to a March/September Release Cycle

Ghostty will move to a 6-month release cycle for major/minor releases,
with the next minor release (1.3.0) planned for March 2026. A March/September
release cycle aligns well with many major Linux distibutions and macOS.
Patch releases (e.g. 1.2.1) will be made as needed on an unscheduled basis.

This is a relatively long release cycle for modern applications, but
let's the development team focus on large, impactful features with enough
time to stabilize in tip releases. For packagers, it avoids the churn of
packaging new releases frequently. And the alignment with major OS releases
let's us ensure we ship major releases that work well on new OS versions.

For users who are interested in more frequent updates, we recommend using
the [`tip` release channel](/docs/config/reference#auto-update-channel) on macOS or
[building from source](/docs/install/release-notes/1-1-0#roadmap) frequently on Linux.
We have thousands of nightly users (thank you for testing!) and the entire
maintainer team works hard to keep tip releases stable. For the entire 1.1
to 1.2 development cycle, I can't remember tip releases ever being broken
for daily use.

[^1]:
    "Parity" here is used loosely to describe the most popular, frequently
    used features of other terminal emulators. There is a long tail of features
    we'll likely never fully implement (and vice versa for our features).
