Coming soon.

## Highlights

### Update to Nix 25.05 and Zig 0.14.1

PRs: [#6699](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6699) [#7447](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7447) [#6736](https://github.com/ghostty-org/pull/6736)

Zig 0.14 (and 0.14.1) brings many language and stability improvements over
Zig 0.13. For more information on the changes in Zig 0.14 see the [release notes](https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html).

Ghostty uses Nix extensively in CI, and many developers use Nix development
environments. Updating Nix to 25.05 from 24.11 give us access to the latest
versions of our dependencies (especially Gnome 48).

### Preliminary Support for Localization (GTK only)

PRs: [#6601](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6601) [#6731](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6731) [#6759](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6759) [#6771](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6771) [#6836](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6836) [#6841](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6841) [#6866](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6866) [#6868](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6868) [#6885](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6885) [#6889](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6889) [#6894](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6894) [#6898](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6898) [#6902](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6902) [#6940](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6940) [#6963](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6963) [#6966](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6966) [#7085](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7085) [#7122](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7122) [#7397](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7397) [#7408](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7408) [#7423](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7423) [#7632](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7632) [#7650](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7650) [#7701](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7701) [#7094](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7094) [#7053](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7053) [#6704](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6704) [#6004](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6004) [#7390](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7390)

Preliminary support for localization of the GTK application has been added.
Currently, only GTK GUI elements can be translated. Work on localizing the
macOS application and other parts of Ghostty will arrive in releases after 1.2.
So far, translators have added translations for the following locales:

- bg_BG
- ca_ES
- de_DE
- es_AR
- es_BO
- fr_FR
- ga_IE
- id_ID
- ja_JP
- ko_KR
- mk_MK
- nb_NO
- nl_NL
- pl_PL
- pt_BR
- ru_RU
- tr_TR
- uk_UA
- zh_CN

### Require `libadwaita`

PRs: [#5749](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5749) [#7274](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7274) [#6797](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6797)

Requiring libadwaita was done primarily to reduce maintainer burden as
certain GUI objects had to be developed twice, once for libadwaita and once
for non-libadwaita. This also means that it's easier to take advantage of
the advanced widgets provided by libadwaita as well as make the Ghostty GTK
application conform more closely to the Gnome Human Interface Guidelines.

### Switch to Zig-GObject

PRs: [#6767](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6767) [#6775](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6775) [#6729](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6729) [#6634](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6634) [#6042](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6042) [#6012](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6012) [#6009](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6009) [#5996](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5996) [#5978](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5978) [#5968](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5968) [#5941](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5941) [#5795](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5795) [#7039](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7039)

Zig-GObject uses GObject introspection to generate bindings to GTK4 and related
libraries. Zig has _great_ C interoperability and the GTK headers generally
worked well, but Zig-GObject allows more idomatic Zig code as well as better
type checking. This doesn't result in any user-visible changes but it speeds up
development, allowing changes to the GTK runtime to be developed faster and with
more confidence.

### Use GTK Blueprints

PRs: [#6827](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6827) [#6822](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6822) [#6801](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6801) [#5970](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5970) [#5968](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5968) [#5944](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5944)

Blueprints is the new language for designing Gnome UI elements like windows,
menus, and dialogs. Ghostty takes advantage of Blueprints to design many UI
elements. This allows easier creation, editing, and localization of UI elements
that would have been difficult to do if we generated all the elements using
procedural API calls.

The Blueprint compiler is only required if you are building from a git checkout.
Building from a generated source tarball does not require the Blueprint compiler
because we precompile the Blueprints and include the output in the generated
tarball. This is done so that distributions that don't include the Blueprint
compiler (or have one that is too old) can continue to package Ghostty.

### Terminal Bell

PRs: [#7533](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7533) [#7521](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7521) [#7842](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7842) [#7148](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7148) [#7118](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7118) [#7101](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7101) [#7087](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7087) [#5326](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5326)

Support has been added for the terminal bell (ASCII `BEL` or `0x07`).
Ghostty's behavior when encountering a `BEL` character is customizable with
the `bell-features` and related configuration entries. It is possible to use a
custom audio file as a terminal bell. If you find the right audio file Ghostty
can sound like an Apple ][ now!

### D-Bus Activation and `systemd` User Services. (Linux Only)

PRs: [#7757](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7757) [#7754](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7754) [#7679](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7679) [#7433](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7433)

To ensure that users have the best Ghostty experience possible on Linux, we
install configuration files that enable Ghostty to be launched using D-Bus
activation and `systemd` user services. This ensures that launching Ghostty is
(relatively) slow only on the first launch. Ghostty can also optionally start up
at login so that initialization time is completely invisible from the user.

### Allow multiple OSC color set/reset/report operations per OSC

PRs: [#7429](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7429)

The public release of Microsoft's new editor `edit` revealed a deficiency in the
way that we were parsing several OSC sequences that `edit` was using. This PR
fixes those deficiences and improves compatibility. OSCs 4, 10, 11, 12, 104,
110, 111, and 112 were affected.

### Debian 12 (and Other Older Distribution) Build Improvements

PRs: [#6776](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6776) [#6825](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6825) [#5791](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5791) [#6822](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6822) [#6800](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6800) [#6827](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6827) [#6831](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6831)

In order to keep Ghostty building on Debian 12 (which has some of the oldest
dependencies that Ghostty still supports) we have added CI checks as well
as modified the build system. As part of the CI build chain, we generate GTK
resource files with `blueprint-compiler` and `glib-compile-resources` using Nix
and add them to a source tarball that is archived. Distributions that do not
have up-to-date versions of `blueprint-compiler` or `glib-compile-resources` can
use the source tarballs to build Ghostty.

### Snap Packaging

PRs: [#7623](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7623) [#7341](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7341) [#7267](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7267) [#6831](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6831) [#6827](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6827) [#5987](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5987) [#5820](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5820) [#3931](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/3931)

Many improvements to the Snap build process have been made, with the ultimate
goal of having Snap being an officially supported distribution format (much like
the macOS binaries).

### Hide Sensitive Data in Paste Confirmation Dialogs (GTK)

PRs: [#6054](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6054)

If secure input is enabled, data in a paste confirmation dialog is blurred so
that potentially sensitive data is not inadvertently revealed.

### Keybind Action to Show the GTK Inspector

PRs: [#7468](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7468)

A keybind action has been added to launch the GTK inspector. The GTK inspector
is useful for those wishing to customize Ghostty with the `gtk-custom-css`
configuration entry.

### Only Allow One Config Error Dialog at a Time

PRs: [#7293](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/7293)

In certain cases it was possible to get multiple config error dialogs showing. This
fixes that so only at most one will show at a time.

### `env` Config Option

PRs: [#5309](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5309)

Add a config option to set arbitrary environment variables in launched processes.

### Enable Context Menu Key

PRs: [#5162](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5162)

Add support for the context menu key available on some keyboards.

### Change the Title of a Surface

PRs: [#4127](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4127) [#5769](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5769) [#4217](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4217)

Added the ability to change the title of a surface (which affects tab and window
titles), overriding the title set using OSC sequences by your shell.
