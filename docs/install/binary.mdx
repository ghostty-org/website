title: Prebuilt Ghostty Binaries and Packages
description: |-
  Install Ghostty without building it manually by downloading
  and running a prebuilt binary or package.
---

The Ghostty project only officially provides prebuilt binaries
for macOS. Other platforms may provide packages for Ghostty,
but those packages are not officially maintained by the Ghostty project.
This page will list both official and community-provided binary packages.

## macOS

Official macOS binaries are provided by the Ghostty project and
are available on the [download page](/download).

These binaries are signed and notarized by the Ghostty project.
To install, download the `.dmg` file, open it, and drag the
Ghostty application to your Applications folder. This is the same
process as installing many typical macOS applications.

### Homebrew

A [Homebrew cask](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/ghostty) is available and maintained by the Ghostty community.

```sh
brew install --cask ghostty
```

## Linux (Official)

Pre-built Linux binaries are packaged by distributions and not the
Ghostty project. The packages listed in this section are all official
packages provided by the respective distributions.
[Community-built packages](#linux-(community)) are also available. See
the warning associated with those packages for more information.

If your platform isn't available, you must
[build Ghostty from source](/docs/install/build).

<Tip>
  **Interested in creating a package for your platform?** Check out the
  [packaging
  guide](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/PACKAGING.md). If you
  need any help, feel free to make an issue. Once your package is ready, submit
  a pull request to add it to this page!
</Tip>

### Arch Linux

The latest tagged release of Ghostty is available as
[`ghostty`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/ghostty/)
in Arch Linux's `[extra]` repository.

```sh
pacman -S ghostty
```

Additionally, a recipe for building and installing the tip of the `main`
branch from source is available in the Arch User Repository (AUR) as
[ghostty-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ghostty-git).
Installation may be done with an AUR helper or from source per the
[usual AUR instructions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_and_upgrading_packages).

```sh
# Install Ghostty git
yay -S ghostty-git
```

### Gentoo

Ghostty is available in the official Gentoo repository.

```sh
emerge -av ghostty
```

### NixOS

Ghostty is available in [nixpkgs unstable](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=ghostty).

```
environment.systemPackages = [
  pkgs.ghostty
];
```

### Nix Flake

There is Nix package that can be used in the
[Ghostty flake](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/flake.nix)
(`packages.ghostty` or `packages.default`). This is a good way
to track specific commits of Ghostty.

While the Ghostty project does not maintain any official packages for
Linux, Ghostty maintains an in-repo Nix flake because Nix is used as
our primary development and CI environment. The Ghostty project does
not maintain any official NixOS packages (in `nixpkgs`).

Below is an example:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    ghostty = {
      url = "github:ghostty-org/ghostty";
    };
  };

  outputs = {
    nixpkgs,
    ghostty,
    ...
  }: {
    nixosConfigurations.mysystem = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        {
          environment.systemPackages = [
            ghostty.packages.x86_64-linux.default
          ];
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

<Note>
This isn't an official package in Nixpkgs but it is officially maintained
by the Ghostty project so we put it in the "official" section.
</Note>


### openSUSE

Ghostty is available as [`ghostty`](https://software.opensuse.org/package/ghostty) in the official openSUSE Tumbleweed repository.

```sh
zypper install ghostty
```

### Snap

Ghosty is available as [`ghostty`](https://snapcraft.io/ghostty) in the Snap Store.

```sh
snap install ghostty --classic
```

<Note>
The Snap package at Snapcraft has an external maintainer but the build
process is triggered by official scripts in the Ghostty repository and
the package will be transferred to the Ghostty organization in the future,
probably coinciding with future Ghostty 1.2 release.
</Note>

### Solus

Ghostty is available in the official package repository.

```sh
eopkg install ghostty
```

### Void Linux

Ghostty is available in the official package repository.
