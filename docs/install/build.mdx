title: Build Ghostty from Source
description: |-
  Build Ghostty yourself from source code. This is only recommended for
  people who don't have access to binaries or packages, or for developers
  who want to contribute to Ghostty.
---

<Tip>

**Building Ghostty from source is not recommended for most users.**
If you have access to a prebuilt binary or package, you should use that
instead. See [the binaries and packages page](/docs/install/binary) to
see if a prebuilt binary or package is available for your platform.

If you intend to develop or package Ghostty, please also check out our
["Developing Ghostty"](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/HACKING.md)
and ["Packaging Ghostty"](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/PACKAGING.md)
documents respectively. This page is more oriented towards end users who
want or need to build Ghostty from source for personal use.

</Tip>

To build Ghostty, you need to first install [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).

<Important>

Each version of Ghostty is only guaranteed to build for one **specific** version
of Zig as it is still a rapidly-evolving language. **Either older or newer
Zig compilers may not be able to build Ghostty.** If your package manager
maintains a different version of Zig than what Ghostty requires, you can use
static binary releases of the Zig compiler on the [Zig downloads page](https://ziglang.org/download/).

</Important>

The Zig version that each Ghostty version requires is as follows:

| Ghostty version | Zig version |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| 1.0.x           | 0.13.0      |
| 1.1.x           | 0.13.0      |
| 1.2.x           | 0.14.1      |
| tip             | 0.15.1      |

The official build environment is defined by [Nix](https://nixos.org/).
You do not need to use Nix to build Ghostty, but the Nix environment is the
environment which runs CI tests and builds release artifacts, so it is the most
reliable way to build Ghostty. See the [Building with Nix](#building-with-nix)
section to see how to set up the Nix environment.

Depending on your platform, you may also need to install additional
dependencies to build Ghostty. For Linux, see [Linux](#linux). For macOS,
see [macOS](#macos).

## Getting the source code

Begin by **downloading Ghostty's source tarball**.

<Warning>

While you can compile Ghostty from source by checking out its Git repository,
this is **not recommended** for anyone but Ghostty developers and contributors.
This is because source tarballs contain various preprocessed files that make
Ghostty require far fewer dependencies to compile.

If you intend to contribute to Ghostty, please consult the
["Developing Ghostty"](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/HACKING.md)
documents on how to build Ghostty in a development environment.
While most of the steps are exactly the same, we will be assuming a source
tarball-based build for now on for the sake of simplicity.

</Warning>

For stable releases, source tarballs and their accompanying checksums can be
found at `releases.files.ghostty.org` at the following paths, where `VERSION`
is an unprefixed version number such as `1.0.0`:

```
https://release.files.ghostty.org/VERSION/ghostty-VERSION.tar.gz
https://release.files.ghostty.org/VERSION/ghostty-VERSION.tar.gz.minisig
```

Signature files are signed with
[minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/)
using the following public key:

```
RWQlAjJC23149WL2sEpT/l0QKy7hMIFhYdQOFy0Z7z7PbneUgvlsnYcV
```

For development ("tip") versions, the source tarball can be found via the
[`tip` release on GitHub](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/releases/tag/tip),
under the name `ghostty-source.tar.gz`.

<Important>

The source tarball is **different** from GitHub's autogenerated tarball
labelled "Source code (zip)" or "Source code (tar.gz)": the latter of which does
not contain any preprocessed files, making it identical to a Git checkout.

</Important>

Decompress the release tarball, and then navigate into the unpacked source folder:

```sh
tar -xf ghostty-VERSION.tar.gz
cd ghostty-VERSION/

# Or when using a tip source tarball:
# (REVISION is the commit SHA of the latest commit)

tar -xf ghostty-source.tar.gz
cd ghostty-VERSION-main+REVISION/
```

With Zig and necessary dependencies installed, a binary can then be built
using `zig build`:

```sh
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

On Linux, this will build a ready-to-use binary at `zig-out/bin/ghostty`.
On macOS, this will build the app bundle at `zig-out/Ghostty.app`.

<Tip>

For Linux users: To install system-wide or on your user account, see
[Installation Directory](#installation-directory).

</Tip>

<Tip>

For a debug build, omit the `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` flag. Debug builds
are **extremely slow** (over 100x slower) than release builds, so only
use them for development.

</Tip>

## Linux

### Linux Dependencies

On Linux, you'll need to install header packages for Ghostty's dependencies
before building it. Only a few dependencies are needed for source builds
because Ghostty will build everything else statically by default.

Required dependencies:

- `gtk4`
- `libadwaita`
- `gtk4-layer-shell`
- `pkg-config` or `pkgconf`
- `gettext`

<Important>

If you're using a Git checkout, you also need to install these dependencies:

</Important>

<Tip>

If your distro has yet to package `gtk4-layer-shell` (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04, Debian
12, Linux Mint 22.1, OpenSUSE, etc.), you need to allow Ghostty to compile
`gtk4-layer-shell` from source by adding the flag `-fno-sys=gtk4-layer-shell`
to `zig build`.

</Tip>

#### Alpine

```sh
doas apk add \
  gtk4.0-dev \
  libadwaita-dev \
  pkgconf \
  ncurses \
  gettext
```

#### Arch Linux

```sh
sudo pacman -S \
  gtk4 \
  gtk4-layer-shell \
  libadwaita \
  gettext
```

#### Debian and Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install \
  libgtk-4-dev \
  libgtk4-layer-shell-dev \
  libadwaita-1-dev \
  gettext \
  libxml2-utils
```

On Debian unstable/testing, the `gcc-multilib` package is also required
for building.

#### Fedora

On Fedora variants, use

```sh
sudo dnf install \
  gtk4-devel \
  gtk4-layer-shell-devel \
  zig \
  libadwaita-devel \
  gettext
```

On Fedora Atomic variants, use

```sh
rpm-ostree install \
  gtk4-devel \
  gtk4-layer-shell-devel \
  zig \
  libadwaita-devel \
  gettext
```

#### Gentoo

```sh
emerge -av \
  libadwaita \
  gtk \
  blueprint-compiler \
  gettext
```

#### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install \
  gtk4-devel \
  libadwaita-devel \
  pkgconf \
  ncurses-devel \
  zig \
  gettext
```

#### openSUSE Leap

```sh
sudo zypper install \
  gtk4-devel \
  libadwaita-devel \
  pkgconf \
  ncurses-devel \
  zig \
  gettext
```

#### Solus

```sh
sudo eopkg install \
  libgtk-4-devel \
  libadwaita-devel \
  pkgconf \
  zig \
  gettext
```

#### Void

```sh
sudo xbps-install \
  gtk4-devel \
  gtk4-layer-shell-devel \
  libadwaita-devel \
  pkg-config \
  zig \
  gettext
```

### Installation Directory

Use `zig build` with the `-p` (prefix) flag to install Ghostty into
a target directory. This will setup the proper FHS directory structure
that ensures features such as shell integration, icons, GTK shortcuts, etc.
all work.

For local, unprivileged installs, we recommend `$HOME/.local`:

```sh
zig build -p $HOME/.local -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

With a typical Freedesktop-compatible desktop environment (i.e. GNOME,
KDE), this will make Ghostty available as an app in your app launcher.
If you don't see it immediately you may have to log out and log back
in or maybe even restart.

If Ghostty fails to launch using an app icon in your app launcher,
ensure that `~/.local/bin` is on your _system_ `PATH`. The desktop environment
itself must have that path in the `PATH`. Google for your specific desktop
environment and distribution to learn how to do that.

For system-wide installs, we recommend `/usr` (likely requires `sudo`):

```shell-session
zig build -p /usr -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

### Building with Nix

The Nix build environment can be accessed like any other
[Nix dev shell](https://nix.dev/tutorials/first-steps/declarative-shell.html),
via the `nix develop` command (or `nix-shell` if you don't have the
[`nix-command` experimental feature](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.24/development/experimental-features#xp-feature-nix-command)
enabled).

If you use [`nix-direnv`](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv),
Ghostty provides an `.envrc` file you can source by running `direnv allow`.
This will allow you to seamlessly enter and exit the Ghostty development
environment as you enter and exit the Ghostty repository. Direnv is not
required.

After setting up the Nix environment, you can run the same `zig build`
as on other distributions or you can also build the package with Nix
by running:

```sh
nix build .#ghostty
```

The binary would then be located under `./result/bin/ghostty`.

Building with Nix should yield the same result as building it with Zig,
but with higher reproducibility guarantees that ensure every part of
Ghostty can be built reliably.

## macOS

### macOS Dependencies

#### Xcode

To build the macOS application, you must build on a macOS machine with
Xcode installed and the active developer directory pointing to it. If
you're not sure that's the case, check the output of `xcode-select
--print-path`:

```sh
xcode-select --print-path
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools        # <-- BAD

sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
xcode-select --print-path
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer # <-- GOOD
```

The above can happen if you install the Xcode Command Line Tools _after_ Xcode
is installed.

Next, make sure you have both the macOS and iOS SDKs installed (from
inside Xcode → Settings → Components).

#### Other macOS Dependencies

Ghostty also requires some additional library dependencies to be
installed. You can choose to install them however you'd like, but
the easiest way is via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install gettext
```

<Note>
  If you're using the **Nix development environment**, these dependencies are
  handled for you and you do not need to install them manually.
</Note>

### Mac `.app`

```sh
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

This will output the app to `zig-out/Ghostty.app`.

The app created will use the "ReleaseLocal" Xcode build configuration.
The "ReleaseLocal" build configuration is specifically for local release
builds and disables some security features (such as "Library Validation")
to make it easier to run without having to have a code signing identity
and so on. These builds aren't meant for distribution. If you want a release
build with all security features,
[use the official binary build](/download).
