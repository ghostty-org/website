<VTSequence sequence="BEL" />

The purpose of the bell sequence is to raise the attention
of the user.

Historically, this would
[ring a physical bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character).
Today, many alternate behaviors are acceptable:

- An audible sound can be played through the speakers
- Background or border of a window can visually flash
- The terminal window can come into focus or be put on top
- Application icon can bounce or otherwise draw attention
- A desktop notification can be shown

Normally, the bell behavior is configurable and can be disabled.

## BEL as an OSC Terminator

The `BEL` character is also a valid terminating character for
OSC sequences, although `ST` is preferred. If `BEL` is the
terminating character for an OSC sequence, any responses should
also terminate with the `BEL` character.[^1]

## Ghostty Status

This control character is implemented in Ghostty, although by default
most behaviors that Ghostty implements are disabled. See the documentation
for the [`bell-features`](/docs/config/reference#bell-features) configuration
option for more information.

The BEL character can be used as an OSC terminator. If it is used as an OSC
terminator, Ghostty will terminate any responses with the
`BEL` character.
