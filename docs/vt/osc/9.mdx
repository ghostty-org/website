title: Show Desktop Notification (OSC 9)
description: Show a desktop notification.

<VTSequence sequence={["OSC", "9", ";", "Pt", "ST"]} />

Show a desktop notification with title `t`.

To avoid conflicting with the [ConEmu extensions], which also use OSC 9 due to
historical happenstance, the title should not begin with a number and then a
semicolon (`;`). In practice a collision of this kind should be rare.
Ghostty's parser will silently convert any invalid ConEmu sequence to a OSC 9
sequence, though this behavior should not be relied upon.
