<VTSequence sequence={["OSC", "5", ";", "Pn", ";", "Pc", "ST"]} />

Query or change the [special color] corresponding to `n` depending on the
value of `c`.

[special color]: /docs/vt/concepts/colors#special-colors

`n` and `c` behave nearly identically to [OSC 4](/docs/vt/osc/4), and may
also be repeated multiple times in one sequence. The difference is that `n`
now ranges between 0 and 4 inclusive, corresponding to the five special colors.
