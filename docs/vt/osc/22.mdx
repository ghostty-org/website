<VTSequence sequence={["OSC", "22", ";", "Pt", "ST"]} />

Change the pointer shape to `t`.

Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what values `t` is allowed to have.
Even xterm, the origin of this OSC, remarks that when one uses a custom
cursor theme, "expect it to provide about a third of those names, while adding
others."[^xterm]

Ghostty, like some other terminals like [Kitty] and Foot, uses CSS's list of
standardized cursor shapes, used in the [`cursor`] property. This is by no
means perfect, but it at least is an international standard that is unambiguous
and platform-independent.

**Avoid** using this sequence unless your program only targets certain terminal
emulators, or you can switch between cursor names by detecting the current
terminal.

[^foot]: Foot maps [both CSS and X11 names](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/src/tag/1.25.0/cursor-shape.c#L62-L102)
to [`wp_cursor_shape_device_v1::shape`](https://wayland.app/protocols/cursor-shape-v1#wp_cursor_shape_device_v1:enum:shape)
enums, which are also based on the CSS standard.
