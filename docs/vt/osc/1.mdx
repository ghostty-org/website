<VTSequence unimplemented sequence={["OSC", "1", ";", "Pt", "ST"]} />

Change the window icon name to `t`. The exact method of locating the icon
data through the icon name is platform-dependent.

Ghostty and most modern terminal emulators do not implement this sequence
as its behavior is not well-defined or even possible on all platforms,
which is also the conclusion reached by
[Foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/pulls/1832#issuecomment-2304415).
