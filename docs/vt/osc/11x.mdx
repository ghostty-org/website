title: Reset Dynamic Colors (OSC 110–119)
description: Reset dynamic colors based on their indices.

<VTSequence sequence={["OSC", "Pn", "ST"]} />

When `n` is between `110` and `119` inclusive, reset the
[dynamic color] corresponding to `n`.

[dynamic color]: /docs/vt/concepts/colors#dynamic-colors

The correspondence between `n` and the dynamic colors are as follows:

| `n`  | Color                      |
|------|----------------------------|
| `110` | Foreground color           |
| `111` | Background color           |
| `112` | Cursor color               |
| `113` | Pointer foreground color   |
| `114` | Pointer background color   |
| `115` | Tektronix foreground color |
| `116` | Tektronix background color |
| `117` | Highlight background color |
| `118` | Tektronix cursor color     |
| `119` | Highlight foreground color |

> [!NOTE]
>
> Currently, Ghostty only supports `n` between `110` and `112` inclusive. All other
> dynamic colors are ignored.

> [!NOTE]
>
> xterm allows a trailing semicolon (`;`) to come after `n`.
