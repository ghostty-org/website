<VTSequence sequence={["OSC", "8", ";", "Pp", ";", "Pu", "ST"]} />

Mark the start of a hyperlink. Cells after this sequence are all considered
part of a hyperlink to the URI `u` until the end of a hyperlink is reached,
marked by a lack of any parameters `p` or the URI:

<VTSequence sequence={["OSC", "8", ";", ";", "ST"]} />

Parameters are colon-separated (`:`) key-value pairs joined by an equal sign
(`=`). Currently the only recognized parameter is `id`, which links together
separate cells of the same hyperlink object, provided that they share the same
URI. Terminals primarily use this information to highlight all linked cells
when the user's cursor hovers on them, but other uses are possible.

When a `file://` URI is specified as a part of this sequence, one additional
requirement is that the hostname must be specified, otherwise the terminal
will refuse to process it. This is because terminal users commonly use SSH
to access remote machines, and file links without a hostname may be
erroneously interpreted to refer to local files that may or may not exist.
