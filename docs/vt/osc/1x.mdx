title: Query or Change Dynamic Colors (OSC 10–19)
description: Query or change dynamic colors based on their indices.
---

<VTSequence sequence={["OSC", "Pn", ";", "Pc", "ST"]} />

When `n` is between `10` and `19` inclusive, either query or change the
[dynamic color] corresponding to `n` depending on the value of `c`.
`c` may be provided **multiple times**, each separated with a semicolon (`;`).

If `c` is given as a single character `?`, then the terminal will respond with
the [color specification] of the dynamic color at index `n`. If `c` is a valid
color specification, then the dynamic color is changed according to it.

[dynamic color]: /docs/vt/concepts/colors#dynamic-colors
[color specification]: /docs/vt/concepts/colors#color-specifications

If there are more `c`s left in the sequence, then `n` is incremented by one,
and the process repeats.

The correspondence between `n` and the dynamic colors are as follows:

| `n`  | Color                      |
|------|----------------------------|
| `10` | Foreground color           |
| `11` | Background color           |
| `12` | Cursor color               |
| `13` | Pointer foreground color   |
| `14` | Pointer background color   |
| `15` | Tektronix foreground color |
| `16` | Tektronix background color |
| `17` | Highlight background color |
| `18` | Tektronix cursor color     |
| `19` | Highlight foreground color |

> [!NOTE]
>
> Currently, Ghostty only supports `n` between `10` and `12` inclusive. All other
> dynamic colors are ignored.

As an example, this sequence changes the background color and the cursor color
to `red` and `blue` respectively:

<VTSequence sequence={["OSC", "11", ";", "red", ";", "blue", "ST"]} />

This is equivalent to combining an OSC 11 and an OSC 12 together:

<VTSequence sequence={["OSC", "11", ";", "red", "ST"]} />
<VTSequence sequence={["OSC", "12", ";", "blue", "ST"]} />
