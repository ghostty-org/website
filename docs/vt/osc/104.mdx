title: Reset Palette Colors (OSC 104)
description: Reset colors in the palette.

<VTSequence sequence={["OSC", "104", ";", "Pn", "ST"]} />

Reset the color in the palette at index `n`. `n` can be specified **zero or
more** times, separated with semicolons (`;`)
When `n` is not specified, the entire palette is reset.

When `n` is between 0 and 255, the normal 256-color palette is used.
When `n` is above 255, however, they instead map to
[special colors](/docs/vt/concepts/colors#special-colors), with 256
mapping to the first special color (bold), 257 the second (underline), etc.
This makes it behave equivalently to [OSC 105](/docs/vt/osc/105) with the index
subtracted by 256.
