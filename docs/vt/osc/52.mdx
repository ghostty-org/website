<VTSequence sequence={["OSC", "52", ";", "Pt", ";", "Pd", "ST"]} />

Query or change data on clipboards specified by `t` based on the
value of `d`.

`t` is a list of **zero or more** characters that each correspond to
a different type of clipboard on the system. The meaning of each character
in `t` as defined by xterm is as follows:

| `t`     | Type                |
|---------|---------------------|
| `c`     | Standard clipboard  |
| `p`     | Primary clipboard   |
| `q`     | Secondary clipboard |
| `s`     | Selection clipboard |
| `0`–`7` | Cut-buffer `0`–`7`  |

> [!NOTE]
> Ghostty only recognizes `c`, `p`, and `s` as valid values in `t`.
> Other types are treated as aliases for `c`. When `t` is omitted,
> Ghostty defaults to querying or modifying the primary clipboard
> (equivalent to `c`).

> [!WARNING]
> Ghostty currently only allows specifying one clipboard per sequence.
> This is a limitation on our end and may be fixed in the future.

When `d` is the single character `?`, the terminal will reply with
another OSC 52 sequence with the data found from the first clipboard
listed in `t` that contains the requested data.

Otherwise, `d` is expected to be a Base64-encoded string that contains
the new data for all clipboards listed in `t`.

If `d` is neither a valid Base64-encoded string or the character `?`,
all clipboards listed in `t` are cleared.
